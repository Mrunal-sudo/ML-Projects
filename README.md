# ML-Projects
## ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This project is inspired by a real experience I had while traveling during the Sankranti holidays.  
Living in Hyderabad, traffic is a common challenge, but thanks to the metro I usually manage well. On that day, I left **1.5 hours early** to catch my train.  
However, it took **25 minutes just to find a Rapido bike ride**, even though bike rides are usually the most affordable and convenient option for me as an individual.  
I reached the railway station just in time â€” the train was already moving, and with the help of a policeman, I managed to board while carrying two bags.  
If I had missed that train, I would have also missed my connecting flight the same night, ruining my entire vacation.  

That incident made me wonder:  
**Why canâ€™t platforms like Rapido or Uber predict the rush level or booking demand, and deploy more drivers in advance?**  
This led me to design a **classification model that predicts rush levels** so that demand can be better managed and customers donâ€™t face such delays.

For this project, I experimented with classification algorithms such as:
- **Logistic Regression** â†’ simple baseline for binary/multi-class prediction  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests** â†’ capture basic non-linear booking patterns  
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** â†’ achieved the best balance of accuracy and generalization  

âœ… **Final Choice:** Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
