# ML-Projects
## ðŸ”¹ Introduction

The idea for this project came from a personal problem I faced while living in a PG (paying guest).  
We had a **recharge-based electricity meter** shared among residents, with just one geyser, a single room, one tube light, one fan, and laptop charging.  
Despite minimal usage, the monthly electricity bill would often reach **â‚¹1100**, which felt unusually high.  
This inspired me to build a **machine learning model to predict actual electricity consumption (in units)** and compare it with billed values.  
Such a system could help households and shared accommodations understand their true usage, avoid overcharging, and plan energy-saving strategies.

To achieve this, I experimented with multiple algorithms:
- **Linear Regression** â†’ simple, interpretable baseline model  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor** â†’ captures non-linear usage patterns  
- **Random Forest Regressor** â†’ ensemble model with best accuracy and robustness
