What about BJP's unabashed Muslim appeasement politics, getting all corrupt politicians from other parties into BJP, not taking legal actions against Rahul on tons of cases, which includes having multiple passports, throwing Nupur Sharma under the bus, inaction on atrocities committed by Mamta in West Bengal - the list goes on.

9GscBMFnoi8,"Why @BJP4India has become so lethargic and lazy that it does not even respond to overtly false propaganda of the corrupt and proven anti-Hindu, anti-India dynastic vestige of khangress and is trying to do the bidding of his anti-India fund-masters sitting in foreign lands. It seems that @BJP4India does not have top leaders of the level of L.K. Advani or Murli Manohar Joshi who had together made BJP a household name. Remember how Murli Manohar Joshi took it upon himself the challenge of furling our national flag in Lal Square, and L.K. Advani was carrying out nationwide rathyatra to bring awareness about Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. There are hardly any leaders in BJP who are allowed to work boldly and innovatively for @BJP4India without the permission of Modi. It appears Modi is all and everything in BJP and he is has overgrown the entire organization of @BJP4India. 
If @BJP4India wants to get its popular votes or if it wants to keep its committed voter base intact, it has to come out of the shadow of Modi, and it must understand that Modi is not @BJP4India. He is just part of BJP and he has grown in the BJP. So, @BJP4India must start its work from right now independent of Modi and his group. There is a saying in one of the south Indian languages which says, ""Akka sattaru Amavasya nilladu"", which means even if one's sister dies, the Amavasya will not stop coming and Amavasya and Poornima keep on coming and going despite anybody dying or getting born. So, Modi, with due respect to him being the greatest PM the nation has ever had, is not above @BJP4India and he must help @BJP4India grow further so that new leaders arise on the horizon to  take up the reins of the organization. It is sad that @BJP4India is not increasing the strength of its IT cell, which is the need of the hour. They must pick the stories of rampant corruption and lawlessness in corrupt and traitorous khangress-ruled states and make them viral as to how khangress is destroying the economy of the states it is in power. One is at loss to know why the @BJP4India IT cell is not able to set its own narrative of exposing the entire corrupt and proven foreign dynastic vestiges who are allegedly not even Indian citizens with allegation of them having multiple passports. @BJP4India must widen its network of social media activists and social workers and nationalist journalists and nationalist youTubers, the latter doing great work, much more better work than the useless @BJP4India's IT cell. It must support independent, freelance writers, journalists and YouTubers and hire them on contract basis so that they will also start firing their narrative to counter the false propaganda and lies and deceit of these corrupt and proven anti-Hindu, anti-India dynastic element and his mentors/tutors. Once the @BJP4India's own IT cells and social media activists and YouTubers start firing shots at these dynastic anti-Hindu, anti-India elements, the fight is taken to the enemy camp automatically. 
In summary, @BJP4India must start its work at the grassroots right from now onwards independent of Modi and his group, I repeat Modi and his group, and start grooming for new generation leaders. Its grassroots workers must involve RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal cadres and they must start a door-to-door awareness campaign about the excellent work @BJP4India and Modi government have done in the last ten years and also about telling the common people that @BJP4India is for uniting all Hindus despite their castes and it must also tell poorer and dalit people that there won't be any removal of reservations meant for Hindu backward classes and how their social and economic condition can be further improved. The RSS and VHP have their own widespread cadre network and their help must be sought at the grassroots level so that the poorer sections and common people who are less literate and who depend on false narratives to get information,  must be informed that @BJP4India will never let any poorer sections of the society down. Next, the lower and middle level leaders must be made to visit their villages, taluks and block levels to be in touch with the people and their committed voters. In a similar manner, the next level leaders must be made to visit their constituencies to oversee the developmental work going on there as also to be in touch with leaders of various communities to redress their grievances and their complaints. 
Lastly, I have got one great expectation from the only leader I have some trust in, for he keeps his word of acting firmly, Shri Yogi Adityanath. He must look into these things: 
1. Check the voter lists that were used in the last election and check if there were any list of bogus voters included in them, who were not Indian citizens. He must also arrange to check the names of the dead or deceased people of a particular community that were not deleted from the list, which led to proxy voting.
2. Check if the government officials at the booth level and taluk and district level bureaucracy which was certainly involved in bogus voting and rigging of voting; Otherwise, it is difficult to explain how UP muslim vote percentage was about 92%-95%, when most of young people are out of the state to work in distant places such as in Mumbai, Kolkota and even Chennai, and most of these were not in a position to go back to UP to just vote. Similarly, there are many invalids, severely ill patients and severely disabled people who are not able to go to booth and vote. So, this matter must looked very carefully investigted to find if there were fake voter lists too. If lower employees working at booth levels or bureaucrats working at block or district lever were involved in massive rigging and bogus voting serious action must be taken against them. 
3. Check if the corrupt @BJP4India leaders were 'bought' by paying huge money or wealth so that they will ask voters to not to vote for them through their private workers and were instrumental in defeat of BJP. 
4. Check if the candidates selected to contest were of lower credibility and were not fit to contest such elections and they were forced by some one in central leadership on UP. 
To conclude, unless @BJP4India starts working at grassroots level independent of Modi and his group, right from now and must involve its own cadres from RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal in grassroots level to awaken and protect its voter base, the chances of @BJP4India doing well in the next of hustings is quite impossible. That is like warning bells for @BJP4India.",Neutral

fQCKKkEJxtQ,"My two cents on the difference between Modi n RaGa...

Modi has come up the hard way, from grass root level and has politics(in the true sense) running through his veins.
His journey has been of continuous learning and growth. 
He thrives on embracing challenges, 
seeking feedback, 
fostering connections and  develop  mindset, behaviors, and relationships that allows him to take on challenges and opportunities and do extraordinary things.
He has long term visions and a drive to fulfill them.

Rahul is here by fortunate birth. 
He hasn't struggled even for a day!
He's doing his best in the position forced on him by his over ambitious mother. 
Sure he'd prefer sunning on a beach with friends.
Unfortunately he cannot articulate his thoughts properly and lacks the capacity for intelligent n coherent speech. 
He lacks leadership qualities n for all the education he claims to have, he's unable to address a large gathering of business entrepreneurs without putting his foot in his mouth. 
He's like a babe in the woods...no experience whatsoever in running a village panchayat leave alone a country!
He had Amethi for 10 yrs of UPA rule but has nothing to show anything he did there.
His concepts are totally impractical n dangerous. 
To put it simply...

Hearing the perspective of an analyst made me very happy not only because of his deeper analysis but as an analyst myself, it was interesting to see and look for new paths of forming pattern within a chunk of data.

Also Ganesh bro, we need to grow your brand as an influencer and then have someone interview you. Imagine our country with at least 2-5% of population (especially youth) with your level of critical thinking and determination to be as objective re your profession as possible. I don't know how to do it but we need to somehow educate our children & youth to think more critically, do theri own analysis, do their own research, form their own thoughts, think for themselves.

Base on previous podcasts including with BeerBiceps it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre not a fan of the Modi government.

Your hosting and questioning of Shantanu Gupta was very unbiased and included many difficult and wise questions. I congratulate and thank you.

fQCKKkEJxtQ,"Being in Eastern UP in 90s. I can very well say, for people to survive  the ""Goonda raj"" was just look the other way, and pray that you are not caught at the wrong time at the wrong place. Corruption was the way of life. Infact it was called as ""Suvidha Shulk"".  If any local goonda wanted you to do something for them, they will not take no for an answer. All of them where like tributary to the larger river of Atik Ahmed, Mukhtar Ansari, Brijesh Singh, etc. I remember how forcing to give answers during UP board was quite common for those students who were good in academics, to help the others.... Every paan shop will have some eve teasers standing there passing remarks.... All of it has gone now. Some of clearing of Goondas started during Kalyan Singh Govt, but again by the time Samajwadi and BSP came to power, things were back to normal... First time STF (Special Task Force) was formed during Kalyan Singh Govt, which had entire UP as their Jurisdiction. Many may remember the rampant goonda raj under Samajwadi, when the famous statement of Mulayam Sing for some r**pists were as ""Ladke hain galti ho jaati hai"" For me this Yogi raj still looks like dream. Things on the ground are improving, but at a very slow pace. But you can feel the difference. The reason is simple. If there a small number of cockroaches are there baygon spray may be effective.

Besides IIT's how many institutions can India create to develop that innovative talent. All the social equity will fall in place post that. As per Suhel Seth, BJP government is the worst communicator of its own achievements.

On another note, the success of the BJP might lead to its demise. The new voters start their life as leftist and most of them transform to the right wing at a later phase of life. Also they don't know about the hardships of pre Modi era. They might bring back Congress as they have no expectations from the BJP.

He made multiple hypocritical statements like that in the whole podcast. I really want you to be best podcaster if just asking question and listen to their response that is done by everyother podcaster, i liked that you not letting him get away from manipur point but he said some bullshit statements  same with manufacture decrease or unemployment and that's not on you.And ask more hard questions you only did 3 this time, ask why govt failed with gst where it encourage consumer market/state and decoupage manufacturing market/state by give more gst money to consuming states like bihar rather then producing states like TamilNadu. Please do not let them get away with type of hypocritical statements or maybe its a job for journalist i don't know but i want that to see in you where not letting them get away with these. And if it's not too much work or financial unviable add fact check reports in video when guest make same claim or say facts because i do my research but many other take it at face value which wrong and i know too much to ask but i will be glad if you do it.

fQCKKkEJxtQ,"Ganjoo chacha should become a bangalk, if he is not one already;  permanent diarrhea of the mouth, sans much introspections.  Did you ask ganjoo daddoo what shantidoots, pasmanda or super-ashraf, in UP [ and everywhere in Ma Bharat, for that matter] think? 

No matter if their multiple shanti-tools are plated with gold, the ONLY EMOTION that moves their heart is hatred of Bharat Ma and of the Sanatana Dharma; their women are their way   '' to conquer Bharat Ma for ''shantivarta'' .

 Himanta Biswa Sharma suggested in several interviews the need to create a class of  ''citizens'' with no voting rights, should they choose, consistently', to mock the national interest.


UP is not the whole of Bharat Ma. What effect has Adityanath on Mewat, on SriBanga, on Gopalganj, Araria and Katihar districts of Bihar?Ganjoo should give up convincing himself of his anokhi smartness and go take a sobering look, not just at UP itself, but states similarly burdened by a huge population of shantidoots with their shanti vartas.

Being a ganjoo from Sri Bangabhumi myself, i can recognize the dreaded illness afflictiing those like us: all talk and no substance. I would be the happiest person in the universe, not just Mother Earth, if Adityanath helped win 80/80 seats in UP and 450 seats in Bharat mata, and repeated that feat over decades, even after Pradhan Sevakji is no longer at the helm. I wish ganjoo diarrhea and Adityanath every bit of auspicious fortune possible, but fear greatly that no pandering to this and several other ''minorities'' will ever do any good for Ma Bharati.  

I have no answers and pray that ganjoo, his hero, and similar are proven right, and continue to come up with useful solutions. Shantidoots in our western, eastern, and northern [nepal] should become a matter of serious concern for ganjoo chacha, and arouse in him an impulse to reflect and analyze with genuine profundity; not just in front of an audience.  The evil stalking our sacred motherland is just too terrifying. Let ganjoo go and study Nepal in depth for a change, and truly dedicate himself to the genuinely great goal of serving his beloved motherland.",Positive

fQCKKkEJxtQ,"@ThinkSchool
I dont think this ""interview"" was helpful for me, it basically was a 2 hr ad for BJP. The reason I would wanna watch such videos would be to add perspective from as many sides as I can, it certainly was interesting to know about Yogi's background. But as the interview went on Shantanu Gupta was allowed to say many points that were half truths in favor of the BJP without getting counter questioned or getting the facts corrected in description or using any other way. One of his tactics seems simple, all bad things under BJP are because Congress ruined the country, and all progress is because of BJP's excellent tragedy. Some examples would be:

 - He mentioned India held Moto GP for the first time. --> True, but the racecourse was inaugurated in 2011, that's pre BJP and there also has been an F1 race held previously. There is nuance to why it closed down unlike how it was presented here


 - He comments on how BJP reduced caste vote and instead united Hindus --> Honestly great thing but then he completely forgets to talk about muslims and BJP's bulldozer politics, the lynching, mistreatment, so on, and so forth

 - He justifies the COVID era with thalis and motivation... and no cross-questioning on their on-ground facilities and effectiveness? --> Also, in that segment around 1:02:00 (approx) he keeps trying to show how Hinduism and Sciences are advancing the nation, I'm sorry but this triggers me, science and religion do not mix and Politics and religion SHOULDNT be mixed, there is plenty of literature on many previous civilizations who doomed themselves by thinking they should mix.

- He also mentions multiple times that BJP would be anti-corruption in the next term --> well they should be, since thats what got them into power in 2014, but again there was no cross questioning about the BJP washing machine as MLAs are constantly avoiding ED and CBI raids by changing parties and joining BJP while he is quick to malign opposition

- 1:48:50 honestly feels like final nail in the credibility coffin of Shantanu since his statement ""that temples cant be made if a mosque is made over it"" is ENTIRELY FALSE and is a provocative statement at best (comedians have had FIRs for less). The following is the link to that act
https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/PlaceWorshipAct1991.pdf
It basically protects Indian ""Places of Worship"" landmarks as they were in 1947, so that a repetition of the Babri Masjid does not happen. THIS INCLUDES PROTECTION OF PLACES THAT ARE CURRENTLY TEMPLES (OR HAVE BEEN SINCE 1947)
and again, no counter question, correction in description, speech bubble to for correction.

And AFTER ALL THAT, you make snide remarks (in 1 of your previous videos) when people say there is at least SOME kernel of truth to India moving towards Dictatorship tendencies.
moving towards != is
Yogi adityanath has on multiple occasions ""otherised"" certain communities with his comments like ""80% vs 20%"", ""ration going to abba jaan"" and many many more.

fQCKKkEJxtQ,"Ganesh bro üëã you should look into the Greek philosopher Plato's
1. Theory of Education
2. Theory of Philosopher King/Queen & 
3. Theory of Communism.

Then you will be able to understand that Yogi Adityanath is an ideal Philosopher King as he spent decades in acquiring spiritual/philosophical knowledge and his love ‚ô•Ô∏è for this knowledge made him to discard worldly pleasures such as getting married & having kids.

Now Plato's Theory of Communism mentions that when you have a family you will always be worried about your children's future hence you force yourself to indulge in corruption & nepotism even against your ethics & morals so that your children can have a better future.

But Yogi Adityanath (or the Philosopher King) had no desire to start his own family then there are definitely less chances for him to get involved in corruption. This makes him an ideal candidate to rule the state in order to end corruption & nepotism as Plato once said ""Until philosophers are the rulers orrulers learn philosophy, there is no end to the predicament or misery ofhuman life"". This resonates very well with the BJP ü™∑ that's why you see the BJP's top leadership are single/separated like Atal B Vajpayee, Narendra Modi or Yogi Adityanath.

A Philosopher King is treated as a person who has high levels of intellectualism as he spent decades educating himself on various subjects that's why when Narendra Modi did demonetisation many Indians did not oppose his decision rather they took the pain to stood in front of banks because they believed Modi is an intellectual who has genuine reasons to take such a bold decision.

Throughout history there are various examples of Philosopher Kings such as Alexander the Great, Ashoka the Great (influenced by Buddhism), Akbar the Great (founder of Din-i-Ilahi religion), Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore or the current Ayatollahs of Iran.

It's truly stunning to see how Plato's 2500 years old theories are still relevant in today's context. üòÅ

Ganesh I pursued UPSC Political Science & International Relations (PSIR) optional from a super awesome tutor (sorry I can't reveal the tutor's name for privacy reasons üòä) which has definitely made me better understand how the world functions.

This is the biggest reason that we are seeing such high unemployment. As manufacturing picks up all these young people will be absorbed just like what happened in USA after 1920s",Positive

Bjp currently works on the basis of charismatic party leaders image - and they  themselves have tried that in these 10 years , no image of Mr Modi shouldn't get bad and they have tried to save and do that , and i believe bjp will go on this process only of fighting election on charismatic leaders image üòÖ...but somewhat it makes mp / mla reliable only on that factor which is bad , and lot of mp can't win elections on their own tbh , i hope in future bjp would be able to solve this problem too .",Positive

If someone analyze any country that has developed. Its all becsuse of huge push on infrastructure development. (Singapore for example)
BJP is pushing india's infrastructure to a new level with 6 line highways, vandhe bharat trains, constructing railway tracks, and the bridges to reduce travel time. 

Congress is providing free money to people. Exactly what Venezuela did and look at its state now. (Despite having one of the largest oil resource, its economy is shattered, because of freebies). 

Creating development is a time consuming process. Its just like how any assets generate wealth. Be it investment in education, investment in share market, investment in real estate or even investment in infrastructure. It takes time. 60 years of freebie culture did nothing for the indian economy. Lets Keep faith in Namo üß°",Positive

fxlFPxg3NiA,"The Congress party has historically been perceived by some as relying on divisive politics to consolidate its support, with criticism suggesting that this approach leverages social divisions to secure votes. In contrast, the BJP has made efforts to unify Indians, focusing on the well-being of all citizens without distinctions. This shift has created tension among some political opponents and scholars worldwide, whose perspectives may not align with India‚Äôs current trajectory under the BJP.

The term Hindutva‚Äîwhich emphasises pride in Hindu cultural identity‚Äîhas sometimes been misinterpreted, though Hinduism itself has long been an inclusive and pluralistic tradition, welcoming diverse viewpoints. Some scholars in the West may not fully recognise the integral contributions of Hindu philosophy to concepts of equality and secularism, principles that are often traced to the roots of Indian culture. These values have indeed shaped aspects of modern global society, and while comparisons with other religious traditions are complex, Hindu culture remains largely defined by tolerance and respect for diversity.

Hindutva is a term that translates to ""Hinduness"" and represents a political and cultural ideology primarily associated with Hindu nationalism in India. Originally articulated by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in his 1923 pamphlet Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?, the ideology emphasises India as not only a geographic nation but as a cultural and spiritual homeland for Hindus. Hindutva seeks to define Indian culture in terms of Hindu values and principles and often advocates for policies that prioritize Hindu interests in public life and politics.

Over time, Hindutva has evolved into a broader socio-political movement. Groups associated with it, like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), promote Hindu unity, aim to preserve Hindu cultural traditions, and have taken a stance on issues like religious conversion, cow protection, and the construction of Hindu temples at historical sites.

While its supporters view Hindutva as a unifying force for Hindus and a way to protect and promote Indian heritage, critics argue it can marginalize religious minorities and undermine India's secular framework by blurring the line between religion and state. The ideology remains a contentious subject, impacting Indian politics and social discourse on identity, citizenship, and religious freedoms.

The idea of Hinduism being secular relates to the unique nature of Hinduism as a belief system and its role within the social and cultural landscape of India. Unlike some religions that prescribe a strict set of beliefs or demand exclusivity, Hinduism is highly pluralistic and inclusive. It allows for a wide array of beliefs, practices, and even non-belief, meaning it is often described more as a ‚Äúway of life‚Äù or a cultural framework rather than a narrowly defined religion. Here are some key reasons why Hinduism is often considered inherently secular:
1. Pluralism and Inclusivity

Hinduism embraces a vast spectrum of philosophies and practices‚Äîfrom atheism to polytheism to monotheism. The diversity within Hinduism means it does not enforce a singular doctrine or require adherence to specific beliefs. This openness creates an environment where multiple perspectives coexist, aligning with secular ideals of tolerance and inclusivity.
2. Coexistence with Other Faiths

Hinduism has historically coexisted with other religions, absorbing and sharing cultural elements. In regions where Hinduism is predominant, it has traditionally fostered an atmosphere where multiple faiths can coexist peacefully, aligning with the secular notion of religious plurality.
3. No Central Authority

Hinduism lacks a central religious authority or governing body, unlike many organised religions that might enforce specific religious laws or dogmas. This decentralization makes it adaptable to various cultural contexts and less prescriptive about how public or private life should intersect with faith, encouraging a secular outlook.
4. Recognition of Diversity in Worship

Hinduism‚Äôs inclusive nature is reflected in its acceptance of diverse practices and beliefs about God, morality, and rituals. A Hindu might worship one god, many gods, or none at all and still be considered Hindu. This flexibility allows for personal freedom and aligns with secular values that respect individual choice and diversity.
5. Hinduism and the Secular State

Modern India‚Äôs founding leaders, inspired by Hindu values of tolerance and inclusivity, established the nation as a secular state. While India is a Hindu-majority country, the secular framework ensures equal treatment of all religions and maintains a separation between religion and government, an approach that aligns with Hindu philosophy‚Äôs acceptance of multiple paths and ways of life.

In summary, Hinduism‚Äôs inherent pluralism, lack of dogma, and historical openness to diverse beliefs contribute to its compatibility with secularism, emphasising a personal and cultural identity that is inclusive rather than exclusive. 

So I put it we have Congress led country whose leaders were all educated overseas, thay continued the divide and rule policy of the British to provide reservations and create seperation that enhanced their ability to gain votes.

The perception that Western countries often talk negatively about India can be linked to several factors, including cultural misunderstandings, differing political interests, and selective media coverage. However, it's important to note that the full picture is complex, and while there may be critical coverage, there is also significant respect and appreciation for India‚Äôs contributions globally. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why negative perceptions may sometimes feel more prominent:

1. Media Sensationalism

Western media tends to prioritize stories that attract attention, and sometimes, negative stories ‚Äì such as social issues, poverty, or political conflicts ‚Äì gain more traction. These stories might overshadow the positive aspects of India‚Äôs progress, innovation, and rich culture, leading to an imbalanced portrayal. This issue is not exclusive to India, as similar coverage affects perceptions of other non-Western countries as well.

2. Cultural Differences and Misunderstandings

Western countries and India have distinct cultural, religious, and social norms. Western perspectives can sometimes misunderstand or misrepresent these aspects, especially when it comes to issues like family structures, societal roles, and religious customs. These differences can lead to biased or superficial judgments that fail to capture the nuances of Indian society.

3. Geopolitical and Economic Competition

As a growing global power, India is increasingly seen as a competitor to Western economies. This competition can influence how Western countries view India, and critical narratives sometimes arise from strategic interests, particularly on issues like trade, technology, or military alliances. Western countries may frame India‚Äôs policies or actions in a negative light to align with their political agendas.

4. Focus on Human Rights and Social Issues

Western countries often emphasize human rights, and they may be quick to criticise other nations based on their standards or norms. India‚Äôs size and diversity create unique challenges that are not always present in smaller or more homogeneous countries, and Western coverage may magnify certain issues, leading to perceptions of a negative bias.

5. Echo Chambers and Stereotypes

Stereotypes and echo chambers can also play a role. Many people in Western countries may not have a full understanding of modern India, its advancements, or its diversity. As a result, outdated stereotypes around poverty or social challenges persist, which can cloud Western views and focus more on India‚Äôs challenges rather than its strengths.

6. Indian Diaspora and Changing Perspectives

Despite these challenges, perspectives are gradually shifting. The growing Indian diaspora and India‚Äôs contributions to technology, science, culture, and business are increasingly recognised, influencing more balanced portrayals. Additionally, as India strengthens its presence in global affairs, many Western media and institutions are shifting toward a more nuanced view that includes both India‚Äôs challenges and successes.

Ultimately, while Western perspectives can sometimes seem critical, they are also evolving, especially as India‚Äôs influence grows and its diverse contributions gain recognition worldwide.

Each year, millions of devotees donate gold, money, and other valuables, making it one of the wealthiest Temple. 
The main reasons for government oversight is financial; the government is reluctant to relinquish control of such a significant revenue source to a private board. Given India‚Äôs status as a developing country with a vast population of 1.2 billion people, maintaining a rule-based order is a tall order.

E5QeCgfCz7o,"Why did BJP lost its value in 2024 ?

Hindutva Decade - The Lost Opportunity (Thread)

In 2014, Frustrated from appeasement of Congress, Hindus united and gave full majority to BJP and gave again in 2019

This 2014-24 was the Hindutva decade
There was a govt in power chosen by Hindus with full majority

1/21
Image
It was the 1947 moment for Hindus

The opportunity to revive Hindu civilization that faced 1000 years oppression from Islam and Britishers but they lost in 1947 due to betrayal of Nehru

Hindu got this opportunity again in 2014
It was once in a life time opportunity
and this time Hindu gave this opportunity to Modi

to revive Hindu civilization
they gave full 10 years with absolute powers

But bad luck of Hindus this opportunity was again missed
Modi govt main focus remained on Muslim empowerment

Lets check in this thread what we lost
Hindu education

Hindus were brainwashed and systematically converted into self hating Hindus by Marxist education

If Modi govt wanted they can introduce Hindu education in NCERT but they didnt make any effort for this


They never tried ek haath mai computer ek hath mai Gita
Image
History Books

History was distorted, Real History was removed and fake Mughal history was included by Congress in school books and BJP kept proudly saying we didnt change a comma in history books

At the end they changed something but it was very small
Marxism in Higher education

Our technical education was safe from Marxist attack.

There is a subject called Humanities but it was optional.
Modi govt sud have removed it but they made it compulsory and opened the doors for Marxist professors in technical education also
Image
Full freedom to Leftist professors to control Universities

We were expecting that all these leftist professors who have been brainwashing Hindus would be kicked out from campus but they actually become more powerful

No action was taken against any leftist professor
Image
NRC

Demography change is biggest threat for Hindu civilization and its mostly happening due to huge influx of immigrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar

NRC was in manifesto of BJP but despite it BJP didnt implement it
They even gave flats to Rohingya in Delhi
Image
UCC

If BJP wanted they cud implement it by just amending two IPCs

- By amending IPC and ban polygamy
- by amending IPC and make uniform age of marriage for girls in all religion

These two amendments were enough to implement 90% of UCC but......
Blasphemy law

Most of anti Hindu content, anti brahmin content comes on media

If BJP wanted they cud make strict law to ban such content on media like they made SC/ST act on but...........
Image

Waqf Act

If they wanted they could easily repeal this act but they actually strengthened it

They digitalized all waqf properties
They made provision to give loan at interest free rates for waqf properties
Minority Ministry

There was no minority ministry in India before 2006
It was made by Sonia Gandhi to appease Muslims

We all were expecting that Modi govt will not continue this ministry but Modi govt not only continued it but increased there budget by 3-4 times
Pink Revolution

Modi ji said in his 2014 election speeches that he would ban cow slaughter and reduce beef exports

But no efforts were made to stop cow slaughter even cow vigilant were sent to jail and beef exports increased many times
Image
OBC Reservation to Muslim
BJP fought its 2024 election on this issue

Under Modi govt, Muslim enjoyed benefits of minority schemes also and OBC reservation also
No efforts were made to remove Muslim reservation in central list
Temple Freedom

This could have been the greatest help to protect Hindu civilization and to stop the great temple loot to free Hindu temples from govt control

Since this subject is in concurrent list so Central govt have full power to make law on it

But.....
Love Jihad

This is currently the biggest threat and biggest issues for Hindus

Forget to make any law on it, BJP leaders never even acknowledged it (Except election time)
Image
Foreign Funding

Most of anti Hindu tasks like religious conversion, ideological subversion are being executed by help of foreign funding

They banned many NGOs but didn't ban funding
Infect when researchers tried to expose this funding they removed details from their website
Symbols of Slavery

Taimur road, Babar road, Khilji road, Akbar road, Shahjahan road are still in Delhi but still no roads on name Pandava who built Delhi

Karnavati is still Ahmedabad
Bakhtiyarpur is still there
Aurangzeb tomb is still grand than Shivaji smarak
Muslim Appeasement

BJP won 2014 only on this issue
But on name of sabka saath sabka vikas they took it at next level

Share of Muslim in govt job was 4.5% during Congress they took it to 10.5%
They increased Muslim representation in IAS
They gave 5 crore scholarships to Muslim
Image
Muslim population is 15% but they gave 30%-35% welfare schemes benefits to them

SC/ST Act
BJP govt made it super draconian during 2014-18 and this act further divided Hindu society
Image
2014-24 was the greatest opportunity to revive Hinduism at concrete level but we lost this opportunity
Some efforts were definitely made but they were more of fancy than something robust

This type of opportunity comes once in a thousands of years
And we lost it again

 In india, the ancient native culture is still the majority, depsite 1000+ yrs of islamic, arab, turk and european christian onslaught.

India was the only place on earth where jews were not persecuted for the last 2000yrs of their exile, and where religious minorities of all stripes sought refuge and were welcomed after fleeing the deadly devastation of islamic expansion for the last 1400 yrs.

The mind bending gymnastics that is deployed to tarnish the only surviving pluralist and open society since ancient times, is mind boggling!

They fear the potential of weaponization of Hinduism, and although it might seem wrong but the truth is in this vikari-vishwa (where all things deteriorate with time) only the strong are respected, if you do not hold a weapon no one will give you respect. This can be seen by the disregard of non-nuclear countries by other large powers because even if a war strikes them they won't have the power to resist.

The european colonialist have stolen and purposefully surpressed the knowledge and history of the ancient india including all its discoveries and glory. They have also gone to the extent to break up the civilisation and lie about everything associated with hinduism. However what they have failed to do is understand that Indians and Hinduism are one and the same. The Maha Rishis have forseen the atrocities being committed through the passages of time and have thus ensured that the culture will survive through practices embedded through daily living and communities. Furthermore, due to the liberal natuer of hinduism in always seeking the truth through question and discovery allows a true hindu to rediscover his or her history and culture including religious practices. It doesnt help that some hindus want to gatekeep the knowledge among the select few for power but this is the time of Kali yuga where we all live in and thus it will depend on each hindu to seek the truth.",Negative

CygRisJNS-g,"Mr. Adi, greetings! I love to watch or listen to your shows and I am an eager subscriber. I consume all your offerings, barring those with Abhijit Iyer Mitra in it.

That said, I have to sadly observe that your earlier programs had better language, though your content is consistently improving. When once one starts using swear words here and there, one keeps on getting emboldened and the quantity of such language keeps increasing with each passing show. You don't feel the need to roll back as your subscriber base is only increasing, that perhaps makes you think that you are indeed barking up the right tree.

Your guests like RSN Sir, Sood Sir, and the rest of them keep their language clean and decent because they know it is honourable to keep the language refined for all the various categories of consumers of the show. I am sure they too know all the words, but the dignity of their language enhances the level and quality of your show. 

Your profanities are not helping. My humble suggestion is that while I want your content to keep going up the way it is doing now, your language could go back in time a tad bit to the more refined Adi Achint of the past.

Rabindranath Tagore was one of the chief movers against the first partition of Bengal ( known as Bangabhanga) in 1905. Rabindranath kicked off his knighthood after the Jalianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. And as far as Jana Gana Mana is concerned it was first sung in the Congress party convention in 1912. Anybody who has read that poem knows the Hindu motifs used in the poem. Rabindranath never hankered for any award. Rabindranaths don't get honoured with Nobel prizes, nobel prizes get honoured with Rabindranaths. Rabindranath himself mentioned in the 1930s, that Jana Gana Mana was not to honour any foreign king but in honour of his own country.

He was born in an area called ""Mirganj"" in Allahabad. That's where the family lived before Anand Bhavan. Mirganj was a muslim ""tawaifon ka mohalla"" - Allahabad's heeramandi. So what was an upright Kashmiri Pandit family doing in an area in the 19th century where even respectable muslims wouldn't live. These facts were there in JLN's biography by Frank Moraes, printed early 60s,a leading journalist of the day. Not sure if the original unedited book is still available.

Part I: The Seed

Chapter 1: Shadows in the Corridor

The monsoon rain pelted the stained windows of the Vidhan Bhavan as dusk swallowed the capital. Inside, the corridors echoed with hollow footsteps‚Äîbureaucrats scurrying like ants, ministers trailing aides like shadows. But one man walked alone. Calm. Purposeful.

Arvind Rathore stood at the far end of the central hallway, eyes fixed on the Chief Minister's chamber. He wasn‚Äôt a minister. Not yet. He wasn‚Äôt even elected. But power, true power, didn‚Äôt always need an office.

To the media, he was a policy advisor. To his rivals, a cunning backroom manipulator. But in truth, Arvind was the architect behind the ruling party‚Äôs most decisive victories. The strategist who whispered the right words into the right ears at the right time‚Äîand watched empires tremble.

Today was different. Today, he didn‚Äôt just want influence.

He wanted control.

A peon brushed past him nervously, avoiding eye contact. Arvind‚Äôs presence had that effect‚Äîdiscomfort born not from arrogance, but from precision. He was the sort of man who made people feel they were under examination.

The door to the Chief Minister's chamber opened, spilling light into the hallway. Prakash Deshmukh, the CM, stepped out, flanked by his loyalists. He was aging, soft-spoken, loved by the media, and thoroughly predictable. Just the kind of man Arvind knew how to use‚Äîand remove.

""Arvind,"" Deshmukh greeted him with a tired smile, ""Come in. We need to talk.""

Inside the chamber, Arvind took the chair opposite Deshmukh, declining tea.

""You‚Äôve seen the reports?"" Deshmukh asked, gesturing to a folder.

""I prepared them,"" Arvind replied.

Deshmukh chuckled weakly. ""The youth wing is restless. The coalition partners are getting bold. And there‚Äôs talk of early elections.""

Arvind leaned forward. ""Then we must start pruning the branches before the storm hits.""

Deshmukh frowned. ""Meaning?""

""Meaning,"" Arvind said quietly, ""we identify the threats, isolate them politically, and ensure loyalty through reward‚Äîor fear.""

The old man looked disturbed. ""You make it sound so... ruthless.""

Arvind offered a small, cold smile. ""Survival in politics isn‚Äôt about kindness, sir. It‚Äôs about certainty.""

He left the chamber minutes later, his next steps already forming in his mind. Three MLAs were to be broken. One minister humiliated. A journalist neutralized. All within ten days.

DdQx0eaTf2w,"I commented this earlier and I'll comment this again: One of the biggest victories that PK has scored is reinstating the lost Bihar pride into the minds of the people. 

India (Through Congress) betrayed us with the Freight Equalization Policy for ~ 50 years and led us to Laloo, and then started their shameless racism towards ALL people of Bihar, including the likes of us who are safely in the 99 percentile of top earners of this country. The racism towards us is laughable, especially when it was India's  colonization of Bihar that doomed us to Laloo's jungleraaj. Modi-Nitish proved themselves to be utter failures, and couldn't do much on the ground. Modi deliberately skipped visiting Bihar and has done almost nothing of note for Bihar. Only when destiny made him embarrassingly dependent on Bihar, has he, rather grudgingly, started talking about the state. 

When you see PK, the first words that come to mind are: Jai Bihar! Thats the halo the man carries. Keep a tab on the ground beneath your feet, it's shaking.

Nevertheless, I feel good that someone is setting the correct political narrative. This will have far-reaching consequences in the long run for not just Bihar but for the whole of India. Bihar has a history of changing the direction of India multiple times through Mahavir, Buddha, and Ashok. In the recent past, JP also changed the direction of Indian politics, but it did not help Bihar much other than wiping out Congress from Bihar and UP. I hope this time he implements pragmatic politics that will help Bihar economically, rather than politically and socially. Economic development is the best way to bring social change. Without a plan for economic development, any promise of social change is less likely to last. I am very happy that he is making people realize the true power of a vote in democracy. Without realising the power of the ballot, democracy feels useless, and we think the Chinese system is better. So, make an honest wish when you see the voting button next time.",Positive

DdQx0eaTf2w,"I am from Sheohar, Bihar, and I have seen poverty up close.
The biggest problem in Bihar is not education but hunger. Hunger doesn‚Äôt mean everyone dies in a year, but people are far behind in terms of physical growth. Some households survive only because women go out to collect wood, use it as fuel, and then work all day in 38¬∞C heat ‚Äî only then do they get food grains. In many places, they don‚Äôt even get paid.
If even 70% of the wages earned by Bihari laborers working outside the state were paid to them, they would prefer to stay in Bihar itself.

DdQx0eaTf2w,"35:33 absolutely right, I'm from Patna, and when I see development happening all around here, it feels like it's happening everywhere in Bihar. But the reality is quite different.
Nitish Kumar deserves credit for two major achievements:
1. Electricity (You might not believe it, but even rural areas in Bihar now have consistent electricity. The government focused heavily on power infrastructure, and as a result, industries have started coming up)
2. Roads (most of the roads here are indeed in good condition)
But the overall pace of progress hasn‚Äôt been what it should‚Äôve been. Now you might say, ""But Bihar has the highest growth rate!"" Well, that‚Äôs bound to happen, when you're starting from the bottom, even small improvements show up as high growth. It's like comparing India to Western countries, India will show higher growth, but it's because it's still developing.

Also Nitish Kumar‚Äôs mental state seems to have deteriorated significantly. Despite this, the NDA still plans to make him the Chief Minister again. He seems to be losing awareness of his surroundings, you can find several videos that clearly show this. He‚Äôs never seen alone anymore, always accompanied by party members and deputy CMs.
Honestly, I believe Bihar should give Jan Suraaj a chance. And I say this even though members of my own family hold positions in both BJP and RJD.
If NDA wins, they should consider leaders like Shahnawaz Hussain or Nitish Mishra (the current Industries Minister of Bihar, whose department is genuinely doing a fantastic job). I see both of them as visionary leaders.
As for RJD, I don‚Äôt know why, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to trust them. Anyway, let‚Äôs see what happens after the results come out.",Positive

DdQx0eaTf2w,"A 90-100 cr carrying capacity nation is carrying a population of 144+ cr, census not done! So how will it be solved??

Ideal Population Distribution of India: A Reality Check

India‚Äôs demographic situation has reached a critical point, severely impacting governance, development, and sustainability. While the ideal population for India should be around 90‚Äì100 crore, the current unofficial estimate exceeds 144 crore, as proper census enumeration remains pending. This is the main thing that poses a substantial challenge to national progress.

State-wise Ideal vs. Actual Population Estimates:

Uttar Pradesh:
Ideal: 15‚Äì16 crore
Current: 25 crore

Bihar:
Ideal: 8 crore
Current: 13 crore

Maharashtra:
Ideal: 11 crore
Current: 12.5 crore

West Bengal:
Ideal: 7 crore
Current: 10 crore
Note: The population surge here is less due to high birth rates and more a result of the catastrophic Partition of India and the massive refugee influx. Unfortunately, no substantial national policy was enacted to address this.

Madhya Pradesh:
Ideal: 6.5 crore
Current: 8.5 crore

Rajasthan:
Ideal: 6.5 crore
Current: 8 crore

Gujarat:
Ideal: 6.5 crore
Current: Approx. similar

Odisha:
Ideal: 3.5 crore
Current: Approx. similar

Chhattisgarh:
Ideal: 2.5 crore
Current: 3.2 crore

Delhi:
Ideal: 1.5 crore
Current: 2.5‚Äì3 crore

People can already see issues of frustration, restlessness,traffic,public fight, stamped each and everyday on the news.
Until India reduces its population by at least 30%, effective governance, policy implementation, and equitable welfare distribution will remain deeply compromised.

The current  pressure obstructs and will always continue to obstruct:

Economic growth,Environmental sustainability,Social infrastructure delivery,Judicious resource management,Technological and institutional capacity-building,Cultural and social harmony

The unchecked population surge is not just a challenge‚Äîit is the central crisis throttling India's growth potential. Without addressing this root issue, every other reform or policy initiative risks dilution or outright failure. It is imperative that we acknowledge this bitter truth and act decisively.",Positive

He is not going to get anything in this election but maybe in next election he might be able to fetch some good numbers. 

P.S.: Met this man personally multiple times, He is prashant kishore Pandey like Ravish kumar is Ravish kumar pandey.

This is a provocative question and meant to provoke respectful debate. 
Look around at the political parties. They either family run or autocratic. The Congress Part, DMK, SP, and Telugu Desam typify the first category. The BJP, and Trinamool typify the later. Defy the existing party deities, and you will be ploughing a lonely furrow. Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Capt. Reminder Singh  are good examples. Nobody in the parties defy the ruling deities in the BJP (Shotgun Sinha) and TMC (even didi has fallen prey to the family rule promoting her nephew). For all its faults, and I am not an admirer of Kejriwal, the AAP seems to stand apart. The Part hierarchy is middle class and educated. One wishes that it drops its pathological hatred of NAMO and the BJP. It should become a ""responsible "" opposition.  Criticize the Government when needed, give credit when deserving. Shashi Taroor, a favorite of mine, might soon be casting around. He would be a great asset to the AAP if the Party is willing to reform itself into a responsible opposition party. Harking back to the pre independence days, the INC was very democratic with many equals like Nehru, Patel, Rajaji, Babu Rejendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu, and Amrit Kaur to mention a few. Gandhi ruled by the force of his moral stature, not by family connections.

My trip was unrelated to such topics related to politics so I was unaware of the election environment so seeing the large gatherings in the fields outside of the city was impressive.  Travel in the city on the weekend was impossible because most of the traffic circles were occupied by campaign speakers surrounded by massive throngs of people.  All of these gatherings were sponsored by the party that went on to win that election cycle.  When I returned home I started following global media coverage with a heightened interest and was surprised to find none of the coverage was giving even the slightest of a correct prediction on the eventual victor for that cycle.  Publications like the FT were doing all of their reporting from an office desk in London or the clubhouse of like minded.

vCnhmvUsec4,"That was a great video. You sir have truly managed to summarise one of the most confusing institutions on the planet. Beneath the infinie levels of Byzantine bureaucracy, there exists a system that somehow works. It has managed to hold itself (even if barely) for almost 80 years now. That's a huge feat considering the examples of many other post-colonial nations sharing similar starting conditions. I'd say the secret to this lies in something called the Panchayati raj. Surely you might have come across it while researching for this video. It essentially treats every village(of which there are a lot in India) as a republic of it's own, with it's own council(panchayat). Now this isn't something India created after 1947. The panchayati system of governance has been present in India in one form or the other since atleast the time of the 16 Mahajanapadas. Across millennia the core of which makes up India has stayed the same. This means the way society is structured and ""managed"" has been able to go through quite some refining. Invaded time and time again by foreign threats, this system has survived the test of time into the modern era and continues to guide the democratic values in such a humongous nation.

vCnhmvUsec4,"India's supposed to be a parliamentary democracy, but in practice acts like an executive dominated democracy, Indian parliament is in practice far weaker than even the US Congress in the presidential USA, the same applies to state legislatures which are even more feeble than the national parliament. Some of this is structural resulting in the extraordinary powers the Indian constitution gave to the executive despite creating a parliamentary republic (for example the ability to create temporary laws called ""ordinances"" sort of like executive orders in USA), how it doesn't really prevent the executive from cutting down parliamentary sessions, the speaker not being very independent in practice, the way Indian parties function, the legal prevention of MPs going against party line in the parliament, etc. So when a government has a single party majority in the parliament, the parliament (especially the Lok Sabha) turns into a rubber stamp of the executive with very little actual checking of executive power. Theoretically the Rajya Sabha offers some protection against this but in practice there are ways to completely bypass it like randomly designating a bill as a ""money bill"" or calling a joint session. When factoring all that only the judiciary actually checks the executive, which is why at times when the executive is very strong electorally they end up at loggerheads with the judiciary and speak of expanding parliamentary power (proxy for their power) against the judiciary like in the 70s or what you were seeing just a few months ago. 
Also the balance between the Union and the State is never very clear in practice either, states have gradually gotten more powerful overtime so although at the immediate post-independence period they were weak when compared to the centre and were easily dismissed by it through ""presidential rule"", today they're pretty powerful entities capable of going against national laws on a number of issues especially those on the concurrent list of the constitution (eg- Tamil Nadu rejecting the education policies of the centre) and are difficult to dismiss.",Neutral

vCnhmvUsec4,"As an Indian, to explain the slightly confusing concept of both Unitary and Federal structure of our government: 
It was done to draw a contrast between the nature of India and some other countries, like USA, UK, and Soviet Union, from where we imbibed some of the ideas for our Constitution. 
In the above mentioned countries, several independent geopolitical units came together to form a Union, the 4 kingdoms of UK, the 13 colonies of America, the Soviet Republics in USSR, etc. And each of these units was equal to each other and largely independent. They had provisions or at least weak ties that could enable them to Secede or break away from the larger Union, like the break up of Soviet Union, the short period of American Civil War, or the presently on going Scottish Independence referendum. 
In India however, this is not the case. We see our country as a single unbreakeable whole, a permanent Union of the People of India (and not states). This Union of people shall divide itself into smaller units (states) for ease of governance only and for no other claims of local autonomy. No territory of India may ever breakaway from the Union. It's punisheable as treason to speak of another separation of India (the horrors of Partition). 
But, such a large population we are, we might not always get along well with our cousins, and tensions will rise, so we prefer to draw lines within our country than across it. That is, we are kinda flexible with our state borders. It's not very easy to carve a new state, but not impossible. However, the Union of India shall always be a single indivisible entity. That's the Federal structure with Unitary features.",Neutral

And then there is Russia where the importance of the PM/President changed with Putin.,Positive
vCnhmvUsec4,"There is extreme delegation of powers to the states in India, which is why India managed to stay united without any coups (unlike nearly all neighbours). Its also one of the reasons development is so hard to come by.

Example:
Party A gets elected into a state. Party A plans for X development projects which are opposed by all opposition parties (because then the people will look up to party A for bringing in development) and opposition parties use all powers possible (fake news, minority oppresion rhetoric, local jobs being lost, people losing land, dragging foreign media into the problems, polluting the environment, etc.). Then the next election opposition gets elected and goes on with literally the same projects they rejected that Party A brought up and now Party A is opposing them.

At the end of the day, nobody wins and no development comes.

Only recently have things started changing, because Hindus of almost all states have started voting in the same party (BJP) so this party can coordinate projects that involve multiple states (freeways, railways, etc.). So now we have sort of an electoral autocracy which i am very proud of, because finally work is actually getting done.",Neutral

HuK2WPmcbjA,"Socialism and the welfare state teaches us to remain dependent on your parents or government even after we have become capable adults. Entitlements create citizens who lack a character trait that every human should have ‚Äî gratitude. You cannot be happy if you are not grateful and you cannot be a good person if you are not grateful. 

Children should be taught to focus on their flaws and  not on societies flaws. Left are far more preoccupied with politics than those on the Right. Since the Left is so much more interested in fixing society than in fixing the individual, politics inevitably becomes the vehicle for societal improvement.

Most of the  young people are so much more likely to be liberal than conservative. They haven‚Äôt lived long enough to really know what does good. But they do know what feels good.

The Left always argue that only the people who agree with him are free of mind-warping ideology and they denigrate opposing viewpoints not as competing ideas or positions, but as the products of a warped, ‚Äúideological‚Äù worldview.

The problem, however, is that you can‚Äôt make society better unless you first make its people better. Conservatives believe that the way to a better society is almost always through the moral improvement of the individual ‚Äî by each person doing battle with his or her own weaknesses and flaws.

Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. Because freedom requires self-control. The freer the society, the more self-control is necessary. If the majority of people don‚Äôt control themselves, the state ‚Äî meaning an ever more powerful government ‚Äî will have to control them.

Capitalism teaches people to work more; socialism teaches people to demand more.

The Right always asks ‚Äúdoes it do good‚Äù and left asks ‚Äúdoes it feel good‚Äù. 

We should measure ideas not by whether they are right or wrong, but by whether they ‚Äúwork.‚Äù Ideas are right if they have ‚Äúcash value,‚Äù",Positive

As Tamil Nadu is relatively more developed (many social indicators like infant mortality rate are closer to those in Scandinavia than to those in the cow belt), religion is less relevant for most of us. Yes, most people here go to their favorite temple, shrine, church, or mosque but unlike the cow belt we are not fanatic about it. We really don't think the election issue should be about building temples or mosques. We feel the more important things are schools, hospitals, and jobs. On the whole, most of us here are very proud to be part of India and the older generation still has lot of memories about the India's struggle for Independence which people here have overwhelmingly supported. When we fought alongside the Hindi people against the British, we wanted local decision making. Of course, all of us were unhappy about our policies being decided in Westminster. however, for us in Tamil Nadu, we never wanted Delhi to be the replacement of Westminster. We were promised and we got a Constitution that balances the powers of the state governments with that of the union. While we have historically deferred to New Delhi for most decision of defense and foreign policy, we have developed our own systems of local taxation, education, and healthcare that has worked very well for us and we have excelled the cow belt on every metric. Now, for the first time, there is a serious threat to federalism. Policies on taxation, education, healthcare, etc, are being forced on to us without out consent. Yet, the mindset is to be patient and try to work out a solution within the framework of Indian constitution. We are still hopeful that will happen but if that does not happen over the next few years, we would all be pushed into uncharted territory and the consequences of that would be unpredictable.

India has been a victim of islamic terror with many terror Attacks of different magnitude which perticularly targated non Muslims. The ""caw belt"" term that you and many other use, even that mocks hindu sentiments as hindus consider cows holy.The Left Wing in India and pertucularly Bollywood have mocked Hindu way of living and the religion for dacads,  which would not have been a big deal if they had done the same treatment with other religions as well.

Swc32mFTQug,"About the Indian ballot: votes are probably not counted with the paper ballots - those are probably used to solve disputes over eventual cases of electronic fraud. In Brazil we use electronic ballots without the paper counterpart and that has been questioned by different parties who eventually change their minds when the opposition questions it - like it happened recently when Bolsonaro asked for the printed system to be added to the machines. People here started to claim the elctronic ballots were impossible to hack and that using paper votes was ridiculous - in part because they want to attack Bolsonaro but in most part because the did not understand what the 'paper vote' was.

The paper vote is a printed version of the vote you deposited electronically - this vote is usually shredded using some special pattern that allows for it to be reconstructed if necessary. The shredding occurs to hide the order of the votes - the first votes would be on the bottome and the last on the top - to guarantee the secrecy of one's vote. Is it necessary? Some say it's technically not necessary - the electronic voting system is mathematically safe - but others often talk about Cesar's wife who 'must not only be honest but must also look honest'. The comparison here is that a voting system - a fundamental component of the electoral system - must not only be secure but also be perceived to be secure. The perception of security give legitimacy to the process.

In Brazil some specialists - from the Computer Science field - noticed the printed vote could be used in the very rare occasions the machines either did not work well or were indeed defrauded. We had 5 cases of which 4 were malfunction but one was fraud. The guy who studied the system in depth, a professor from the University of S√£o Paulo, noticed that case showed a problem with the Electoral Justice (a temporary Justice system that functions only during elections) that required the candidate who made the complaint to pay for the machine to be audited - something that would cost around 1 million R$ (currently 200KUS$ but over 500KUS$ when it happened). The very weird thing is the machine's software system showed its system to be corrupt ... I think the Electoral Justice did not want the bad publicity Cesar's wife could have. In the Professor's opinion, the printed system would make the auditing of the ballot much, much cheaper.

Both India and Brazil have to oversome some logistic problems - we have to take these machine to places where not even Capt. Kirk has ever been before. They have to take around their enormous country and we have to take ours into the Amazon forest. We'll have, next Sunday, elections for President, Representative (MPs), Senators, Governors and State Representatives and people living on small vilages on the banks of the Amazon River will be at walking distance from a ballot machine. Take that US of A! That's how democracy works!

Oh ... btw ... I can guarantee that though the Indian machines are goofy looking they are extremely well designed and extremely well made. 

Thanks for the video! I'll now go back to The Print and resume my viewing of Mr. Gupta piece on the recent elections in Europe.

We are a country, where a Christian steps aside, so that a Sikh can be sworn in as the PM, by a Muslim President, in a country of over 80% Hindus. Such is the unity in India!!!
3) Caste system in India is quite fragile, now. In my generation, people don't even know, what their caste is!!

5) Modi ji was, in no way, involved in the Gujarat riots. He has already been given a clean chit, after months of investigation.

Now let me tell you the cause, because these so called unbiased & secular people in west never will. Those violence erupted after muslims set ablaze a train carrying HINDU PILGRIMS; ‚ÄòSabarmati Express‚Äô in Gujarat. They were burnt alive just because of their faith, including innocent children. Those kids died burning in their parent‚Äôs hand ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I never saw anyone from west mentioning this, because they only see sufferings & victimhood of Abrahamic religions, yet people has balls to say they are unbiased.

Let me give you another example, recently 2 muslims BEHEADED a tailor in his shop just because he was Hindu & supported someone in social media. This news is nowhere to be seen in Arab or western world, while when similar thing happened to French teacher Samuel Paty, these news outlets were filled with it & whole world; especially west was on its toes.

But now it has happened to someone doesn‚Äôt belonging to Abrahamic religion, the world is silent as nothing has happened. If had the victim been a Christian or Jew here, there would have condemnations coming from all western leaders & story was covered in every major news outlet.",Neutral

A group of worshipers returning from ayodhya after pilgrimage were burned alive by the Islamic mob.

This ignited the hindu community of gujraat. Gujraat at that time was also heavily effected by earthquake of 2001 killing more than 15k people.... this all made anger in the hindus leading to a mini Civil War between two community killing a lot of Muslims like 300+ (I don't know the figure).

But the only thing is that many people don't know they reason behind the Muslim killing because they are minority and no one want to listen to majority.

Talking about communal violence; the west just covers violence against Abrahamic religions and nothing is shown about Dharmic religions where hindus, Sikhs, budhhist, Jains are attacked. Nothing, no news coverage. 
Now talking about BJP, so yes it came into existence because Congress was way too Pro Muslim but BJP do not try to impose hindu culture in constitutional laws but rather they make a laws neutral for everybody (which generally was/is not accepted by certain communities and that causes violence and was termed communal by WEST).
Now, Narendra Modi: So he is a person of great vision and the world knows how much India has grown in past 7-8 years, India made its position. The communal riot in 2022 was a retaliation against Muslim mobs who burnt a train killing hundreds of innocents. Though Modi was accused and a case was registered against him but got a clean chit from Supreme Court (the highest court) in 2011-12, that too in the rule of Congress in the nation.

Swc32mFTQug,"So basically, coming to taj mahal and there are other monuments were made after demolishing the Hindu temples. That's why there are campaigns to get them restored to their original state. That too only after an archeological survey.

And talking about the video, it was more focused on Modi than that of Congress and it's nepotism.

Coming to the works of BJP.

Demonization - stopped the duplicate currency circulation in the country which was printed in billions, every second day there would be a fake currency note in the bank which was hard to track.

Introduction of UPI payment method. 
A biggest revolution In Digitalization of money. Even France and few other countries are planning to accept this method of payment made in India. 

GST - scrapping multiple tax policies and combining them into one. A big deal.

CAA/NRC- to maintain border security and have a control over the immigrants as major of the govt services for the citizens are been utilised and controlled by illegal immigrants with the fake documents. Leaving the citizens with no facilities or jobs or the ration. Coz the illegal immigrants have already made duplicate documentation (govt ID). this was that the illegal immigrants supports and votes the political party who gets them that Indian identity.

Make in India campaign - this will boost alot of growth of industrial sectors as
Multiple tax benefits or reliefs are been provided to new start up. Basically one of them is a startup can choose any 3 out of its first 7 years which it would pay zero taxes. That's a big deal coz if planned up properly that's the biggest help. First 2  years loss next 2 year carry forward and break even. And last 3 years during profits no taxes to be paid. 

New Farmers bill- which was completely mis understood by the country. Basically in India agricultural income is exempted from taxes. The old bill had a definition of agricultural activity which restricted the the scope of agricultural income. Therefore the new bill was introduced, where farmers were allowed to sell directly to consumers and pvt company or sell its farming online instead to a kisaan mandi (farmers depot) alone which gave them minimum returns as the stocks in depot were too high than the demand/ supply ratio. To shift that and balance the stock preservation the bill asked farmers to sell outside mandi. But unfortunately Indians aren't that educated to understand this. 

Therefore
 new education policy- India is working on the new education policy where the whole education system would be changed and the method of identifying the talent of the youth will be determined. 
Karnataka is the first state to implement the new education policy already. 

Agniveer- providing jobs to youths 18-22 and paying them money and a job security in armed forces or any other govt sector post 4 years. 

UCC - uniform civil, which is in making.

BTT- bank transaction tax under DTC (direct tax code) which would replace current income tax system. 

EPPB - e property pass books, which will bring the digitisation of property holding rights. That would automatically bring land mafia on the knees. 

Diamond necklace for china's string of pearls and what not is been happening. It's just the advertisement of all the above isn't happening as the cost of advertising would go up. 

Anti corruption bill in making. 
And many more to come. 

But sadly and unfortunately there is a big big contribution of the external forces that is been invested in India that it's internal problems doesn't solve for another 2 decades else India would grow to the world's most powerful country. 
Every bill passed by the government is been protested. Demonetisation or CAA/ NRC, farmers bill, GST, make in India, agniveer everything is been protested in some or the other way, either by stone pelting riots and what not wasting soo much tax payers money being burn down. 

India has the potential but India is already taken over internally these stupids people either who don't understand all these or it's just the greed to make money. It's bad. Coz their number is increasing.",Neutral

In any case I absolutely DESPISE Westerners that try to make analogies between their and our problems, like those saying that there's ""anti black racism in Russia"" (Russia has barely any people from Sub-Saharan Africa), or both white supremacists abd American liberals thinking that Russia is a ""white Christian safe haven"" and a ""white supremacist country"", and even applying it to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, disregarding the basic fact that the very Conservative Muslim North Caucasus is in Russia, so is a part of Central asian stans (Tatarstan), plus also migration from the independent stans, and actually pro-EU Ukraine has way fewer Muslims or migrants than Russia.

Since India is a country of State identity before national identity, it was a good reason to start an pro-Hindu party.

'The fanaticism that exists in the hindu nationalist side...' It is true that fanaticism exists in the hindu right but it is also true that it exists in the muslim minority, and to a larger extent considering their population. They are the most backwards and regressive community in india. Some top muslim leaders are known to have given the vilest, most hateful speeches in front of huge audiences and cheered for it. 

RSS is not a hardcore hindu organisation. It is more of a cultural and nationalistic organisation. I can understand that it might be a little confusing on your part since Westerners tend to look at things more from a religious perspective and do not truly understand the difference between culture and religion. RSS even has a muslim wing. Their main prayer goes like 'namaste sada vatsale matrabhoome' which means we offer our eternal honor and respect to the all loving motherland.

2. North India is not called as ""Cow Belt"".....

In India Hindus worship Cow....but there is no such place or region called as Cow Belt.

3. B.J.P (Bharatiya Janta Party) ....is not trying to make India a Hindu dominated State.....but their ideology is 'One Nation One Culture'....I hope u know that India has been ruled by Britishers for more than 300 yrs...and now the present situation can be described as Neo-Colonialism...so their Ideology is to follow Ancient Indian Culture.....

4. There is no such division of religion based .....Our Constitution protects People of all religion....through Right to freedom of religion....

And violence occurs in all countries....name it where it does not ....


5. If there would be any religion based communal violence as a matter of fact....our top bollywood actors are Muslim.....our late  Ex President A.P.J Abdul Kalam was Muslim.....You name it....

So out of 138 Crore Indians if 0.0001% people cannot describe India as Communal based or cow belt...

Even the Indian National Congress and many other such Centre-left parties have now avoided using this term, as it had resulted in them alienating Hindi-speaking voters, which are the majority in India.

A better term would be Hindi heartland or more simply, Hindi-speaking states.

Swc32mFTQug,"The two major central parties of India are Congress and BJP.
Congress Is a very historic party of India which took a great part in the independence movement while the BJP has its roots to the RSS(Right wing Hindu Body) and other right wing parties.
                A big reason Congress is now unpopular as ever is cause of the corruption scandals of the 2010s and overall the dynastic politics that has plagued the party.
               Which led greatly to the rise of BJP again in the 2014 elections.
                BJP especially Modi however has seen really a worse time for Communal violence,mob lynchings and overall great social unrest.The party in many ways has gone far from the times of Vajpayee(BJP)who is for many the best PM of India.
              The Communist Party never became a really big power in the Centre.However in state politics it was strong but now it only has a stronghold in Kerala.
A big contributor to this demise is the hostility with Communist China and also Naxals (Maoist insurgents) who are also labelled As Domestic terrorists.
                Some examples of famous state level parties are The AAP-Aam Addmi Party(translated to the party of the common man)which has a govt in Delhi,famous for its anti corruption stances.
            Shiv Sena (party which has a strong hold in Maharashtra) which was formally headed by Balasaheb Thackeray.A right wing party itself however the party has now changed with its stance on ""Hindutva"" really different from BJP after the breakup with BJP and now has a large priority to the Marathi identity as it has always done. 
           I only know surface level so I have given a really simplified version of Indian politics.There is a 
Whole different politics In south and north east India.
                Bonus fact

Swc32mFTQug,"Well, you seem to have been mislead, maybe by popular left leaning channel and news portal. Here are mistakes:-
1) RSS isn't an extremist organisation. It is basically a cultural organisation. It even have a muslim wing( Muslim Munch).
2)Too much focus on Nationalism, yeah it is there, but not a primary concern.
3)Yes, religious tensions are there in India. Especially in the area of Kashmir, but as far as I know there is a huge movement of Islamic radicalism going on. Various NGOs( foreign funded) and other Islamic groups have caused huge friction, from Kashmir to Kerala. In Kashmir, Exodus and genocide of Kashmiri pandits ( Hindus) took place in late 80s( you could have easily googled it) led to hundreds of thousands of Hindus killed or homeless. Then there are news of radicalism and that comes from different parts of India very often. However, there are many Hindu reactionary groups that just add fule to it.
4) Hinduism have nothing to do with Hindi. The diversity you are talking about is mainly the diversity of Hindu communities stretching to all parts of India.
5) Yes, congress is blamed for supporting Muslims as they have passed various laws that not only denied Hindu community from their rights but also gave other communities upper hand. Like for example, Muslims can establish and control their educational institutions, however Hindus cannot. Yes, it's true.

1) RSS isn't an extremist organisation. It is basically a cultural organisation. It even have a muslim wing( Muslim Munch).
2)Too much focus on Nationalism, yeah it is there, but not a primary concern.
3)Yes, religious tensions are there in India. Especially in the area of Kashmir, but as far as I know there is a huge movement of Islamic radicalism going on. Various NGOs( foreign funded) and other Islamic groups have caused huge friction, from Kashmir to Kerala. In Kashmir, Exodus and genocide of Kashmiri pandits ( Hindus) took place in late 80s( you could have easily googled it) led to hundreds of thousands of Hindus killed or homeless. Then there are news of radicalism and that comes from different parts of India very often. However, there are many Hindu reactionary groups that just add fule to it.

( 70% of population of India is rural population) . In rural areas caste plays a major role. In fact caste can decide whether you will win or not. Moreover, urban population is young population and mostly active on social medias which is the reason most of political parties have their own IT cells . ( Both Congress and BJP).  Southern region of India has less Muslims so their issues are different.( Mostly related to migration of hindi speakers, dominance of Hindi, local caste effects) where as northen state have Muslims population and totally used as vote banks.( Not a single party really care about their problems).

Swc32mFTQug,"Hi JJ, there's a similar situation with the two main parties in the Republic of Ireland. Traditionally, Irish politics has tended to be focused on (greatly over-simplifying here) whether or not you like a party called Fianna F√°il. Basically, after the Irish War of Independence (1919-21), the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed, which while granting Ireland independence from Britain with a Parliament and a Prime Minister, it also partitioned the country (with Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK), required the independent part to remain part of the Commonwealth with the British monarch as head of state, forced Irish members of Parliament to swear allegiance to the King, and allowed the British Royal Navy to hold onto certain Irish ports. The Treaty caused Sinn F√©in (the main party at the time) to split into two factions, with the Pro-Treaty faction eventually becoming Fine Gael and the Anti-Treaty faction eventually becoming Fianna F√°il.

Swc32mFTQug,"That bjp is strongest in ""cow belt"" is a misleading here. BJP is strongest in gujarat, but Guj. is not a cow belt state. 

Also, BJP is not just supported by upper castes, but by all castes. Modi himself is from a lower/backward caste. The importance of caste in politics is overestimated mostly. Most Indians want better life, better govt . rather than some win of their caste. 

Other points are also there, where I can improve it. But some people may just call it my opinion. Because lot of people insist very strongly without proof that Bjp is a upper caste party. so I'm not even sure what to say to that. 

Lot of people also paint BJP as anti-muslim party. That also is not borne out of facts. its true that 90% muslims don't vote for bjp, because they don't like its policies (such as ram mandir, UCC etc). but that itself can't make bjp anti-muslim, because having differences does not make you enemy automatically. BJP has done a lot to improve lot of Muslims, and there are many muslim ministers in bjp govt too, in senior positions.",Positive
Swc32mFTQug,"A lot of westerners and even some cowbelt Indians struggle to understand Indians political stage is literally an entire continent politics. The closest analogue is European politics if you make European politics even more complicated by merging the EU elections with the country politics...Yea it's that complicated and varied. Each state in India more or less has a population larger then most European countries (5 states have populations well over 100 million and other states average around 60 million with only the smallest states having less then 30 million). On top of this thousands of years of various religious, political and ethnic conflicts on a scale unheard of influence all these states and their issues which then have to be dealt with on a federal level. Europe as mentioned before is the closest analogue but even then they were slowly integrated, India was conquered by the British then had 300 years of poverty, genocide and famine destroying local infrastructure and economy before finally being forced into losing 2 huge parts of India proper (Pakistan and Bangladesh which throughout history served as major sources of trade routes to Indochina and the Middle East) and then having to slowly build itself back up again.

Swc32mFTQug,"I give you a great amount of kudos for undertaking this task. You explained this far better than I have heard it explained before except for probably my friends from India itself. I‚Äôll admit that if I didn‚Äôt have those friends, despite being a practicing Hindu, this would be very confusing (honestly, the people from India are the best people to ask about their nation, government, cultures, histories, religions, gestures, languages, subcultures, etc because they can better explain the myriad complexities that are a part of all that in ways no western visitor or academic or book or movie ever could! At least that‚Äôs my humble opinion anyways). 

I do try to follow the politics in many nations and to understand how governments function in them. Mostly just to see if there aren‚Äôt some ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù that maybe all nations could adopt (I kinda like that India has it so that polling places have to be within a certain distance of people as well as the multiday voting process. I think that‚Äôs a neat idea, but not sure if other nations would adopt the polling location distance rule even though it might help with easing access to polling places and the idea of multiday voting with no results released until a certain date would probably drive corporate media here crazy since they like to cover elections like horse races and want to be first to call winners in hopes to boost ratings or whatever). So if you‚Äôd like to do other nations, that‚Äôd be neat! I mean, you effectively explained Indian politics in a fairly straightforward, no agenda or bias, way and that‚Äôs no small feat in itself! Even the media here can‚Äôt seem to do that! Again, I give you a lot of kudos! This is a remarkable video (and I also appreciate that you attempted to pronounce the names without shifting to an Apu or some other weird accent and just spoke like you normally do. Sure it probably sounds awful to a native speaker, but better to try authentically than mock or offend and I‚Äôd hope native speakers can see that you are authentically and sincerely trying to pronounce the names as best you can. At the temple I am often given practice with pronunciation of words by folks who realize I‚Äôm sincerely and authentically trying, but the aspiration following a consonant and the nasalized versions of letters still elude me, but I have gotten better at long and short sounds like in ƒÅnanda rather than racing through them as if it were ananda and that took practice which I‚Äôm eternally grateful to receive as I constantly learn more and more about India, Nepal, etc where many of the folks at the temple are from).",Positive

Swc32mFTQug,"Honestly I think Modi with have a much harder time winning a majority this time. Though, he is still expected to win a second term what some people (especially the minorities) don't like about him is that during his time in government religious differences have been further accelerated which calls for more severe clashes amongst Hindus and muslims and can cause socio-political divide. The Congress has ruined its reputation by electing the members of the Gandhi family to the top positions even though the family has not always appointed the Gandhi family to power. Three people of the Nehru-Gandhi family have served as prime ministers. 

1) Jawaharlal Nehru (1947‚Äì1964), he was elected easily due to the fact that he was a freedom fighter and had taken India to a better level than its neighbour, Pakistan, even though the two countries got independent just a day apart. 

He was succeeded by a different man who was very simple and wore torn clothes, saying that I can't wear proper clothes until the farmers in my country wear torn clothes. He also gave the motto ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan"" which means hail the soldiers, hail the farmers. He died just two years into office of reportedly a heart attack, though there is controversy that he was actually poisoned. 

From 1966 till 1977 Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Nehru served as Prime Minister until she faced a defeat in the 1977 general elections. The newly formed government of the Janata Dal could not function properly and were usually fighting amongst each other. This caused outrage and eventually early electipns were declared in 1980 in which Indira Gandhi was re-elected. In 1984 she was assassinated by her own bodyguards. On the very same day the Congress party asked her only surviving son, Rajiv to become prime minister. Rajiv took the oath of office and brought along many reforms. I would call him a progressive. He introduced computers to India, much to the disapproval of the BJP which said that computers will cause unemployment (though, Narendra Modi now talks about having a digital India) and Rajiv Gandhi was eventually defeated in the 1989 elections. The newly formed government, again, could not function properly and collapsed, causing the President to declare elections in 1991. Rajiv was expected to win because now people realised that his policies were beneficial for the country. However, he was assassinated in 1991 by Sri Lankan suicide bombers. The Congress Party then led by P. V. Narasimha Rao was elected and served for five years. In 1996 the BJP government was elected and the Indians continuously saw prime ministers changing almost every year, and one MP, Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who was a pretty good prime minister and was elected to a five year term in 1999) was in office for only sixteen days! Elections were conducted again in 1998, and then the following year in 1999. The BJP led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed a government and Vajpayee served as prime minister for a full term (the first non-congress politician to do so). In 2004, Vajpayee was defeated by the Congress party led by Rajiv Gandhi's widow, Sonia Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi appointed another MP and a renowned economist, Dr. Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister. He was re-elected in 2014. However in 2014, Modi's vigorous campaigning caused the Congress to face its biggest defeat under Rahul Gandhi, the son of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi. Modi led the government for a good five years and now it time for election. 

I would like to tell to the westerners who are unaware that in India no matter who leads the party during the elections, that doesn't make him/her a candidate. The party after being elected decides who should serve as Prime Minister. And to all the Indian voters I would say that don't vote for a specific party or leader. You want to vote for the MP candidates of your area who you think will do a better job in making your area a better one. Remember, you don't vote for a prime minister, you vote for an MP. If there is a pothole in your area, the MP will get it fixed, not the Prime Minister. So vote wisely!",Positive
Swc32mFTQug,"Regional parties = Regional caste politics & not necessarily regional interests.

National parties = Both parties have many members of elite ruling class but in early periods before & after India's independence ruling class supported Congress but it got divided due to certain sections of political class's more inclination towards cultural & religious revivalism as well as reformation vis a vis socialist sections of Congress party. 
As time went on due to 'Liscense raj' & lack of market transformation {e.g. Freight equalisation policy which kept the so called 'cow belt' undeveloped} the 'Brahmins/Baniyas' aka Trader class along with priestly class started supporting this divided faction which 'Jan sangh' & is now 'BJP'.

Third part is history related that would require me to write a essay so here is a brief overview - 
Since Hindus were not religiously-political historically the so called 'Left' aka Congress they used the colonial institutions to divide & rule e.g. Police Act 1861 -
a. On one hand propagate & projected equality of all Indians & sections before the law while on other divided the people locally on each & every issue possible which led to regional strongmen politics. This lead to factions moving away from National Congress Party & forming regional Identity politics based parties {Based upon castes mainly} in different regions like BSP, SP etc.
b. The other major problem is the problem of India's history - While Hindu nationalists viewed India's history from it's earliest Hindu-Buddhist empires the left tried to countered this by projecting 'Hindus' as invaders & 'Shramanas' aka Buddhists and Jain & Indigenous people as 'Mulnivasis' or as true inhabitants of India. It resulted in various divisions that are now being used politically - the divisions like North/South India, Aryan/Dravidian, Hinduism Vs Buddhism/Jainism/other Hindu denominations, language divide etc.
The Right wing tried to presented a glorious view of India's past, left wing in effort to keep it realistic actually goes too far to remove such claims about past & this has led to false historical claims from all sides & this fuels Hindu-Muslim divide.",Neutral

I should preface this by saying that I have really started to regularly watch your videos as I find you take the time to not simply understand the topic you speak of but try to provide an honestly balanced view. I like them and I don't want you to take my comment overly negatively. But in a number of your videos you generally make a point of deliberately mis-pronouncing foreign names. Seeing that you have taken such amount of time to really delve into and research your topics, i can only assume that you are doing this willful ignorance of correct pronunciation as a way to inject some humor. But i feel you do yourself a disservice here. I find myself following your videos with great interest and when you stumble over these words, i get pulled out in a very jarring way. Because there is no reason you could not have taken a minute or two to look up how to say these words correctly - [hooray internet]. So you are doing this on purpose for.. laughs? If that is your intent, i think your videos already have different - and frankly very enjoyable - vibe in general due to the way you construct you narrative and your personal delivery. This attempt at a cheap laugh just stands out like a sore thumb in opposition to what makes you unique and interesting, and as well makes you look a little less informative then you are. Once again - keep up the good work.

sV7Yzwa2ww4,"Maybe I'm just wrong, but you guys need to explain me this: 
What exact questions of Mr. Gandhi was the EAM not able to answer? 

Rahul's points: 
1. Indian Foreign Policy's sole goal should be to keep Pakistan and China separate and that the Modi government has failed to ensure that. 
2. The result of that happens to be a ""military fusion"" of China and Pakistan.
3. Two factual points illustrating the said fusion. 

The EAM: 
1. Laid bare the historical development of sino-pak ties and how it got here. 
2. Whilst doing so, pinned the blame on previous governments failure to counter the very charge that Rahul Gandhi is making i.e that of ""fusion"". 
3. Specifically detailing the time of 1967, 1980s Nuclear development support, 2005, 2006, and 2013. 

Politics aside, that ACTUALLY EXPLAINS why the case is what it is today - which was the exact charge being put upon the current dispensation. It's not like we can kill Chinese generals in Pakistan guiding Pakistanis, right? Are we supposed to seek a ""strategic relationship"" with China, then? Is the solution to this ""fusion"" a suck up to China (which is a charge that BJP has consistently maintained)?!

ko8Mrn7ADYc,"If India, along with Russia and China, joins forces with other nations such as those in BRICS, Africa, the Middle East, NATO, and the EU, it could create a significant shift. Many countries are tired of the tariffs imposed by the United States, particularly under Trump, and to counter this, there should be a concerted effort to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance. 

One way to do this is by reducing reliance on the dollar in trade and financial transactions, which could undermine the United States' economic power. Additionally, countries could consider purchasing weapons from France, the UK, and other NATO or EU member states instead of the United States. This could put pressure on U.S. arms manufacturers, especially in the context of ongoing conflicts like the war in Ukraine.

A unified approach could also address issues like the conflict involving Hamas. Arab nations such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE should consider boycotting Hamas and its fundraising efforts. Furthermore, bringing Iran to the negotiation table to find a peaceful resolution could help stabilize the region and prevent further escalation of violence.

Stopping the sale of arms from the U.S. while promoting a ceasefire among groups like the Houthis would support a steady flow of oil and stabilize global prices, countering the disruptive tactics often employed by the U.S. The focus on weapons and warfare has historically put various countries in challenging situations‚Äîexamples include North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Libya, and others.

Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations must recognize the importance of supporting Russia in this geopolitical landscape. The emergence of BRICS and RIC could serve as a foundation to challenge U.S. dominance. Transferring gold, shares, and business interests away from the U.S. towards NATO and EU countries would decrease global dependence on the United States.

Everyone in North America, Central America, South America, the Americas and the American continent is an American like Asia are Asians, Africa are Africans and Europe are Europeans. What happened first? The United States of America or the American continent? The United States of America became a nation on the date of July 4th of 1776 and the whole entire continent was already named America after Amerigo Vespucci in the year 1507 that was 269 years difference way before the United States of America became a nation. Europe has 50 countries, Asia has 51 countries, Africa has 54 countries, Oceania has 14 countries and America is not a country America is a continent of 35 countries in total. Why are people not educated about America? ............The reason why people come here to the United States from all over the world is because the US government goes to their countries and controls and manipulates their governments. The US government and its allies aka puppets invade small countries 10 or more against 1 small country not even bigger than Texas. Both the Democrats and the Republicans are the same snake with two evil heads. The US government is a two face and the number 1 terrorist in the world. The US government invades, kills, destroys, divides, controls, manipulates and steals resources from small countries. .............Homelessness is a choice of life. Life is beautiful but no one said life is easy. Many people have too many excuses in life, more excuses than the exits of freeway 101 located in California. Many people are looking for work praying to God not to find a job. People just want handouts. The more money you give them the more they want. Whoever wants an easy life in life will always have issues, struggle and drama in life but whoever makes a sacrifice in a good way in life will make a benefit in life.

Last month, they were used in Baluchistan to hijack a train and kill Pakistani soldiers, as America does not want China to use the Gwadar port as its maritime port and the 60 billion dollar CEPC project that China is building to connect Gwadar in Baluchistan with China, America has consistently used Terrorism as part of its state craft. This is the reason America has never supported our War against terrorism. Here also, Trump has not blamed Pakistan, as he is aware that the Pakistan army is an American tool to spread terrorism.

Modi, in collaboration with Russia, should take action to restore the Hasina administration. The case is similar to the Maidan revolt in 2014 in Kiev, where an elected government was ousted by the CIA to put the Nazis in power. As Russia could not take any immediate action the war is still going on. Modi should take immediate action without any delay. There is no need for the support of any Western countries, as they in 1971, were against India and the creation of Bangladesh. Only Russia helped.

They make stupid logics! Giving job for the poor is for conversion! The corrupt minds of sanadana followers determined not the natives of this soil should not come up in life.  So they deny them education and now job opportunities.  Now through EMIs make the middle class ones as bonded workers- they work and pay the dues lifelong without enjoying life!

Here this recent episode bajrang dal lady interrogates the sisters in the police station- is it law governed-nation or RSS_BJP-sanadanis- bajrang dal governing nation ?

Further the railway police,  I think  the filed FIR as given by bajrang dal lady accuses the sisters of human trafficking and conversion! 

Can't the judges sense  the flaw in FIR- how come human trafficking and conversion can go together? Trafficking is for the  benefit of the individual who does it; whereas conversion is, for the benefit of the victim- if   a job is offered.  In the Independent Indian Union, as 18 year old citizen has the right to vote for any party,  right to marry anyone, right to undertake any work, he or she has the right to follow any religion!

Remember,  no one has the right to stop anyone who's a major from the above RIGHTS! If someone violates such rights to be punished as per the law!

XrmQFeX--r4,"It is time we speak the truth ‚Äî this is the reality of modern India: Christians are under direct attack. The BJP and its affiliated groups are stabbing at the very heart of the Indian Constitution. Article 25 guarantees every citizen the right to freedom of religion, worship, and propagation. But in BJP-ruled states, these rights are being systematically dismantled.

Churches are being burned, priests are arrested, pastors are harassed, and believers are threatened ‚Äî and the government remains silent. We have freedom only on paper, not in real life. This is not democracy ‚Äî this is persecution under the name of religion.

India was built on coexistence and respect among all faiths. But today, especially the Christian community ‚Äî who have long served the nation through education, healthcare, and social service ‚Äî are being silenced, imprisoned, or even killed for raising their voices. Prayers are interrupted, missionaries are harassed, and legal rights are denied. Is this truly a free India?

Our Constitution guarantees religious freedom through Articles 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 30 ‚Äî but many of these are clearly violated under BJP rule:
	‚Ä¢	Article 14: Ensures equality before law. Christians face biased legal treatment under anti-conversion laws.
	‚Ä¢	Article 15: Prohibits discrimination on religious grounds. Christian schools and hospitals face targeted crackdowns.
	‚Ä¢	Article 19(1)(a,b,c): Protects freedom of speech, assembly, and association. Pastors are stopped from praying, churches are raided, religious gatherings are broken.
	‚Ä¢	Article 21: Guarantees life and personal liberty. Christian women face violence and harassment with impunity.
	‚Ä¢	Article 22: Protects against arbitrary arrest. Many pastors are jailed without due legal aid under false conversion charges.
	‚Ä¢	Article 25: Assures freedom of religion and propagation. Anti-conversion laws and ‚ÄúGhar Wapsi‚Äù violate this entirely.
	‚Ä¢	Article 26: Allows religious communities to manage their affairs. Churches are demolished, and permissions for worship denied.
	‚Ä¢	Article 27: Prohibits taxes for promoting any particular religion. Christians face extra financial scrutiny and tax burdens.
	‚Ä¢	Article 28: Bans forced religious instruction in state schools. Yet Hindutva ideologies are being subtly pushed.
	‚Ä¢	Article 30: Protects minority rights. Christian-run institutions are being denied permissions and unfairly regulated.

From 1998 to 2025, Christians in states like Kerala, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Gujarat, and Haryana have faced violence, imprisonment, church burnings, false conversions cases, and relentless social persecution. The brutal murder of Graham Staines and his sons in 1999, the Kandhamal riots of 2008, the Manipur violence of 2023, and continued arrests of pastors under anti-conversion bills are painful examples of this reality.

Even Mother Teresa‚Äôs missions have been restricted by FCRA bans. Christian sisters are defamed as ‚Äúconversion agents‚Äù on social media. Extremist slogans like ‚ÄúDharma Yudh‚Äù fuel hatred. Anti-Christian rhetoric from political leaders goes unpunished.

This is not just religious intolerance ‚Äî it is a grave threat to the Indian Constitution and democracy itself. Christian sisters and priests are servants of this nation, not criminals.

India must protect Christians and all minorities. We must rise in unity, from every village to every city, and defend the soul of our republic. Let no more churches burn in silence. Let no more innocent priests be jailed without justice. Let our Constitution live ‚Äî not just in courts and speeches, but in the everyday life of every citizen.

Let the silence end ‚Äî let us speak.
The rights guaranteed from Article 14 to Article 30 of the Indian Constitution must be upheld ‚Äî not just for Christians, but for every citizen of this great democracy.",Neutral

All the convent educated kids here saying they were never asked to convert don't seem to realise it is never that simple. The wealthy pay fees and donations. These donations are used to convert the poor and vulnerable to whom a job offer promises liberation from poverty. Changing religion then seems a small price to pay. Shame on the educated affluent for not realising you should not BUY someone's faith that way. Why not give the job without necessarily teaching preaching from the BIBLE, or asking anyone to accept Jesus? I think that Jesus would be pleased that a poor person was helped, without strings attached. This irresponsible soul harvesting is playing with fire. Majority sentiments do matter. If a father is poor and can only feed his child bare minimum, still,  he would still want his child to stick to her roots traditions and faith.

XrmQFeX--r4,"At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord!

Jesus is The only Way The Truth and The life and his second coming is very near. 

Jesus is God himself not just a prophet..The Truine God, The Father The Son and The Holy Spirit are one. The Three in one God.
The Holy Spirit proceeds through both the father and the son. The son was sent by the father to pay the Ransom for the sins of entire mankind so that we Don't perish in eternal fire but have everlasting life in him.

Because of God's steadfast love for all mankind he sent Jesus, his only begotten son to be sacrificed and pay for our sins and for us to be able to ask for forgiveness through the precious blood of Jesus. God made a way for us and the way is Jesus.

Jesus is the ultimate lamb that was sacrificed by our father in heaven. Cause without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. Thats how much the father loves us that he sent his only begotten son to be sacrificed.

Repent and prepare yourself. Everything happening in Israel and Palestine is written in the bible and it will all come to pass word for word for it is the word of God. The Father himself has manifested in his son in his own voice. In Mathew 3:17 ""And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.""

May the spirit of the blessed lord lighten your lives and shine upon you all while we still have the time.

If you deny Jesus today and Don't accept him as the son of God, then he will deny you in front of his father on the day of judgement.

He reported to the police that he had previously been associated with these priests and nuns, but when he realised they had an anti-national agenda and refused to recognise or sing the national anthem, he parted ways with them.

This Jyothi Sharma is a Brahmin and will these people sacrifice their beautiful homes and social status to serve the down trodden people to lift them up? Won't these people consider themselves as those who are born from the head of Brahma and the shudras are born out of legs of Brahma? Weren't these the same people who treated tribals as untouchables and outcasts? Then why such a sudden love came towards these tribals now?

XrmQFeX--r4,"AI Overview

The word ""conversion"" does not appear in the main text of the Indian Constitution

However, the Indian Constitution guarantees the Right to Freedom of Religion under Articles 25-28, according to the website of the Supreme Court of India. 
While the term ""conversion"" is not explicitly mentioned in these articles, the right to ""propagate"" religion is enshrined in Article 25. 

This implies the right to spread information about one's faith and encourage others to learn more, but it is subject to restrictions like public order, morality, and health. 
It's crucial to understand that the right to propagate religion does not equate to the right to convert others forcibly or through fraudulent means. 

Many state laws in India specifically prohibit forced conversions or conversions by inducement, and these are often referred to as ""anti-conversion"" laws or ""Freedom of Religion"" acts.",Positive

They (the Sangh Parivar) and the police very well know that there is no religious conversion happening there.

This is the answer to why the Sangh Parivar is afraid of Christians, who are only 2% of India‚Äôs population: because once children are educated, the feudal upper-caste landlords of the Sangh Parivar cannot get them for bonded labor or exploitation.

This is a provocative question and meant to provoke respectful debate. 
Look around at the political parties. They either family run or autocratic. The Congress Part, DMK, SP, and Telugu Desam typify the first category. The BJP, and Trinamool typify the later. Defy the existing party deities, and you will be ploughing a lonely furrow. Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Capt. Reminder Singh  are good examples. Nobody in the parties defy the ruling deities in the BJP (Shotgun Sinha) and TMC (even didi has fallen prey to the family rule promoting her nephew). For all its faults, and I am not an admirer of Kejriwal, the AAP seems to stand apart. The Part hierarchy is middle class and educated. One wishes that it drops its pathological hatred of NAMO and the BJP. It should become a ""responsible "" opposition.  Criticize the Government when needed, give credit when deserving. Shashi Taroor, a favorite of mine, might soon be casting around. He would be a great asset to the AAP if the Party is willing to reform itself into a responsible opposition party. Harking back to the pre independence days, the INC was very democratic with many equals like Nehru, Patel, Rajaji, Babu Rejendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu, and Amrit Kaur to mention a few. Gandhi ruled by the force of his moral stature, not by family connections.

When I returned home I started following global media coverage with a heightened interest and was surprised to find none of the coverage was giving even the slightest of a correct prediction on the eventual victor for that cycle.

vCnhmvUsec4,"That was a great video. You sir have truly managed to summarise one of the most confusing institutions on the planet. Beneath the infinie levels of Byzantine bureaucracy, there exists a system that somehow works. It has managed to hold itself (even if barely) for almost 80 years now. That's a huge feat considering the examples of many other post-colonial nations sharing similar starting conditions. I'd say the secret to this lies in something called the Panchayati raj. Surely you might have come across it while researching for this video. It essentially treats every village(of which there are a lot in India) as a republic of it's own, with it's own council(panchayat). Now this isn't something India created after 1947. The panchayati system of governance has been present in India in one form or the other since atleast the time of the 16 Mahajanapadas. Across millennia the core of which makes up India has stayed the same. This means the way society is structured and ""managed"" has been able to go through quite some refining. Invaded time and time again by foreign threats, this system has survived the test of time into the modern era and continues to guide the democratic values in such a humongous nation.

vCnhmvUsec4,"India's supposed to be a parliamentary democracy, but in practice acts like an executive dominated democracy, Indian parliament is in practice far weaker than even the US Congress in the presidential USA, the same applies to state legislatures which are even more feeble than the national parliament. Some of this is structural resulting in the extraordinary powers the Indian constitution gave to the executive despite creating a parliamentary republic (for example the ability to create temporary laws called ""ordinances"" sort of like executive orders in USA), how it doesn't really prevent the executive from cutting down parliamentary sessions, the speaker not being very independent in practice, the way Indian parties function, the legal prevention of MPs going against party line in the parliament, etc. So when a government has a single party majority in the parliament, the parliament (especially the Lok Sabha) turns into a rubber stamp of the executive with very little actual checking of executive power. Theoretically the Rajya Sabha offers some protection against this but in practice there are ways to completely bypass it like randomly designating a bill as a ""money bill"" or calling a joint session. When factoring all that only the judiciary actually checks the executive, which is why at times when the executive is very strong electorally they end up at loggerheads with the judiciary and speak of expanding parliamentary power (proxy for their power) against the judiciary like in the 70s or what you were seeing just a few months ago. 
Also the balance between the Union and the State is never very clear in practice either, states have gradually gotten more powerful overtime so although at the immediate post-independence period they were weak when compared to the centre and were easily dismissed by it through ""presidential rule"", today they're pretty powerful entities capable of going against national laws on a number of issues especially those on the concurrent list of the constitution (eg- Tamil Nadu rejecting the education policies of the centre) and are difficult to dismiss.",Neutral

vCnhmvUsec4,"As an Indian, to explain the slightly confusing concept of both Unitary and Federal structure of our government: 
It was done to draw a contrast between the nature of India and some other countries, like USA, UK, and Soviet Union, from where we imbibed some of the ideas for our Constitution. 
In the above mentioned countries, several independent geopolitical units came together to form a Union, the 4 kingdoms of UK, the 13 colonies of America, the Soviet Republics in USSR, etc. And each of these units was equal to each other and largely independent. They had provisions or at least weak ties that could enable them to Secede or break away from the larger Union, like the break up of Soviet Union, the short period of American Civil War, or the presently on going Scottish Independence referendum. 
In India however, this is not the case. We see our country as a single unbreakeable whole, a permanent Union of the People of India (and not states). This Union of people shall divide itself into smaller units (states) for ease of governance only and for no other claims of local autonomy. No territory of India may ever breakaway from the Union. It's punisheable as treason to speak of another separation of India (the horrors of Partition). 
But, such a large population we are, we might not always get along well with our cousins, and tensions will rise, so we prefer to draw lines within our country than across it. That is, we are kinda flexible with our state borders. It's not very easy to carve a new state, but not impossible. However, the Union of India shall always be a single indivisible entity. That's the Federal structure with Unitary features.",Neutral

vCnhmvUsec4,"There is extreme delegation of powers to the states in India, which is why India managed to stay united without any coups (unlike nearly all neighbours). Its also one of the reasons development is so hard to come by.

Example:
Party A gets elected into a state. Party A plans for X development projects which are opposed by all opposition parties (because then the people will look up to party A for bringing in development) and opposition parties use all powers possible (fake news, minority oppresion rhetoric, local jobs being lost, people losing land, dragging foreign media into the problems, polluting the environment, etc.). Then the next election opposition gets elected and goes on with literally the same projects they rejected that Party A brought up and now Party A is opposing them.

At the end of the day, nobody wins and no development comes.

Only recently have things started changing, because Hindus of almost all states have started voting in the same party (BJP) so this party can coordinate projects that involve multiple states (freeways, railways, etc.).

As Tamil Nadu is relatively more developed (many social indicators like infant mortality rate are closer to those in Scandinavia than to those in the cow belt), religion is less relevant for most of us. Yes, most people here go to their favorite temple, shrine, church, or mosque but unlike the cow belt we are not fanatic about it. We really don't think the election issue should be about building temples or mosques. We feel the more important things are schools, hospitals, and jobs. On the whole, most of us here are very proud to be part of India and the older generation still has lot of memories about the India's struggle for Independence which people here have overwhelmingly supported. When we fought alongside the Hindi people against the British, we wanted local decision making. Of course, all of us were unhappy about our policies being decided in Westminster. however, for us in Tamil Nadu, we never wanted Delhi to be the replacement of Westminster. We were promised and we got a Constitution that balances the powers of the state governments with that of the union. While we have historically deferred to New Delhi for most decision of defense and foreign policy, we have developed our own systems of local taxation, education, and healthcare that has worked very well for us and we have excelled the cow belt on every metric. Now, for the first time, there is a serious threat to federalism. Policies on taxation, education, healthcare, etc, are being forced on to us without out consent. Yet, the mindset is to be patient and try to work out a solution within the framework of Indian constitution. We are still hopeful that will happen but if that does not happen over the next few years, we would all be pushed into uncharted territory and the consequences of that would be unpredictable. We have no hatred for Hindi or Hindu but we don't want a more populated but less developed state try to tell us how we should do things in our own state. That is all most of us want!",Positive

Swc32mFTQug,"About the Indian ballot: votes are probably not counted with the paper ballots - those are probably used to solve disputes over eventual cases of electronic fraud. In Brazil we use electronic ballots without the paper counterpart and that has been questioned by different parties who eventually change their minds when the opposition questions it - like it happened recently when Bolsonaro asked for the printed system to be added to the machines. People here started to claim the elctronic ballots were impossible to hack and that using paper votes was ridiculous - in part because they want to attack Bolsonaro but in most part because the did not understand what the 'paper vote' was.

The paper vote is a printed version of the vote you deposited electronically - this vote is usually shredded using some special pattern that allows for it to be reconstructed if necessary. The shredding occurs to hide the order of the votes - the first votes would be on the bottome and the last on the top - to guarantee the secrecy of one's vote. Is it necessary? Some say it's technically not necessary - the electronic voting system is mathematically safe - but others often talk about Cesar's wife who 'must not only be honest but must also look honest'. The comparison here is that a voting system - a fundamental component of the electoral system - must not only be secure but also be perceived to be secure. The perception of security give legitimacy to the process.

In Brazil some specialists - from the Computer Science field - noticed the printed vote could be used in the very rare occasions the machines either did not work well or were indeed defrauded. We had 5 cases of which 4 were malfunction but one was fraud. The guy who studied the system in depth, a professor from the University of S√£o Paulo, noticed that case showed a problem with the Electoral Justice (a temporary Justice system that functions only during elections) that required the candidate who made the complaint to pay for the machine to be audited - something that would cost around 1 million R$ (currently 200KUS$ but over 500KUS$ when it happened). The very weird thing is the machine's software system showed its system to be corrupt ... I think the Electoral Justice did not want the bad publicity Cesar's wife could have. In the Professor's opinion, the printed system would make the auditing of the ballot much, much cheaper.

Both India and Brazil have to oversome some logistic problems - we have to take these machine to places where not even Capt. Kirk has ever been before. They have to take around their enormous country and we have to take ours into the Amazon forest. We'll have, next Sunday, elections for President, Representative (MPs), Senators, Governors and State Representatives and people living on small vilages on the banks of the Amazon River will be at walking distance from a ballot machine. Take that US of A! That's how democracy works!

Oh ... btw ... I can guarantee that though the Indian machines are goofy looking they are extremely well designed and extremely well made. 

Thanks for the video! I'll now go back to The Print and resume my viewing of Mr. Gupta piece on the recent elections in Europe.

1) Crippling poverty. Poverty percentage in India is 10.2% (not 25%). In fact, extreme poverty in India, is disappear by 2030. India is the 5th largest economy in the world, and by 2027, India would be richer than all European countries.
2) Hindu-Muslim tensions. Its the same as White-Black tensions in the west. The west is no innocent. Unity in diversity has been the epitome of Indian civilization. We are a country, where a Christian steps aside, so that a Sikh can be sworn in as the PM, by a Muslim President, in a country of over 80% Hindus. Such is the unity in India!!!
3) Caste system in India is quite fragile, now. In my generation, people don't even know, what their caste is!!
4) BJP is not against English, or Taj Mahal. They are just trying to make Hindi, a common language for the entire nation. English will, obviously, taught in each and every school. Taj Mahal has a bloody history behind it, thus, BJP is trying to glorify other beautiful monuments in India
5) Modi ji was, in no way, involved in the Gujarat riots. He has already been given a clean chit, after months of investigation.
6) Ballot machines are ,not at all, weird looking! Ballot machines in India, are the single best way to stop people from casting bogus votes. At least, its better than USA (In USA, the ballot machines run on second-hand eBay memory cards)

He talked about Muslim losses & causalities but didn‚Äôt mention the same for other religion, for example Hindus, genocide of Kashmiri pandits, Buddhists or Sikhs. He just did what western people & media always do.
He mentioned 2002 Gujarat riots & muslim deaths but didn‚Äôt mention the same for others or even tried to tell the cause of that violence. He even represented numbers wrongly. Those 1000+ deaths aren‚Äôt Muslim deaths but total which includes Hindus & people from other religion as well.

Now let me tell you the cause, because these so called unbiased & secular people in west never will. Those violence erupted after muslims set ablaze a train carrying HINDU PILGRIMS; ‚ÄòSabarmati Express‚Äô in Gujarat. They were burnt alive just because of their faith, including innocent children. Those kids died burning in their parent‚Äôs hand ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I never saw anyone from west mentioning this, because they only see sufferings & victimhood of Abrahamic religions, yet people has balls to say they are unbiased.

Let me give you another example, recently 2 muslims BEHEADED a tailor in his shop just because he was Hindu & supported someone in social media. This news is nowhere to be seen in Arab or western world, while when similar thing happened to French teacher Samuel Paty, these news outlets were filled with it & whole world; especially west was on its toes.

Swc32mFTQug,"2001 gujraat violence. 

A group of worshipers returning from ayodhya after pilgrimage were burned alive by the Islamic mob. It is said that 2-3 coaches were burned and the doors were locked from outside so that people couldn't get out of the train .... the train was on a station when this fire catched. Around 70-80 people were burned alive along with children and women. 

This ignited the hindu community of gujraat. Gujraat at that time was also heavily effected by earthquake of 2001 killing more than 15k people.... this all made anger in the hindus leading to a mini Civil War between two community killing a lot of Muslims like 300+ (I don't know the figure).

But the only thing is that many people don't know they reason behind the Muslim killing because they are minority and no one want to listen to majority. 

Later many cities of gujraat were bombed by Islamic terrorists. Around 14 of them were given death penalty by indian judiciary recently.

So he certainly has been more than unfair in understanding India's problems. Congress didn't make a self reliant India but made a India with no courage to have any view about any issue, internally or globally. You should see what happened in France or other European nations with respect to radical Islam.

PS. Before talking about Gujarat riots, research about how Muslims in India killed thousands of Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir so that they could make it a Muslim state and how they burnt a train coach filled with Hindu women and children (for no justified reason) because of which Gujrat riots happened.

The man talked about poverty. In india the extreme poverty level is below 1%. Talking about corruption and other issues like global hunger index, so that is just a so called Indexes of West. But then the world beg India to export wheat, sugar and what not. Bravo! The reality.
Talking about communal violence; the west just covers violence against Abrahamic religions and nothing is shown about Dharmic religions where hindus, Sikhs, budhhist, Jains are attacked. Nothing, no news coverage. 
Now talking about BJP, so yes it came into existence because Congress was way too Pro Muslim but BJP do not try to impose hindu culture in constitutional laws but rather they make a laws neutral for everybody (which generally was/is not accepted by certain communities and that causes violence and was termed communal by WEST).
Now, Narendra Modi: So he is a person of great vision and the world knows how much India has grown in past 7-8 years, India made its position. The communal riot in 2022 was a retaliation against Muslim mobs who burnt a train killing hundreds of innocents. Though Modi was accused and a case was registered against him but got a clean chit from Supreme Court (the highest court) in 2011-12, that too in the rule of Congress in the nation.
COW Belt! Nothing like that. Wherever there are Hindus, they respect cow. Because in ancient times she is considered as mother who used feed humans in form of milk.

And talking about the video, it was more focused on Modi than that of Congress and it's nepotism.

Coming to the works of BJP.

Demonization - stopped the duplicate currency circulation in the country which was printed in billions, every second day there would be a fake currency note in the bank which was hard to track.

Introduction of UPI payment method. 
A biggest revolution In Digitalization of money. Even France and few other countries are planning to accept this method of payment made in India. 

GST - scrapping multiple tax policies and combining them into one. A big deal.

CAA/NRC- to maintain border security and have a control over the immigrants as major of the govt services for the citizens are been utilised and controlled by illegal immigrants with the fake documents. Leaving the citizens with no facilities or jobs or the ration. Coz the illegal immigrants have already made duplicate documentation (govt ID). this was that the illegal immigrants supports and votes the political party who gets them that Indian identity.

Make in India campaign - this will boost alot of growth of industrial sectors as
Multiple tax benefits or reliefs are been provided to new start up. Basically one of them is a startup can choose any 3 out of its first 7 years which it would pay zero taxes. That's a big deal coz if planned up properly that's the biggest help. First 2  years loss next 2 year carry forward and break even. And last 3 years during profits no taxes to be paid. 

New Farmers bill- which was completely mis understood by the country. Basically in India agricultural income is exempted from taxes. The old bill had a definition of agricultural activity which restricted the the scope of agricultural income. Therefore the new bill was introduced, where farmers were allowed to sell directly to consumers and pvt company or sell its farming online instead to a kisaan mandi (farmers depot) alone which gave them minimum returns as the stocks in depot were too high than the demand/ supply ratio. To shift that and balance the stock preservation the bill asked farmers to sell outside mandi. But unfortunately Indians aren't that educated to understand this. 

Therefore
 new education policy- India is working on the new education policy where the whole education system would be changed and the method of identifying the talent of the youth will be determined. 
Karnataka is the first state to implement the new education policy already. 

Agniveer- providing jobs to youths 18-22 and paying them money and a job security in armed forces or any other govt sector post 4 years. 

UCC - uniform civil, which is in making.

BTT- bank transaction tax under DTC (direct tax code) which would replace current income tax system. 

EPPB - e property pass books, which will bring the digitisation of property holding rights. That would automatically bring land mafia on the knees. 

Diamond necklace for china's string of pearls and what not is been happening. It's just the advertisement of all the above isn't happening as the cost of advertising would go up. 

Anti corruption bill in making. 
And many more to come. 

But sadly and unfortunately there is a big big contribution of the external forces that is been invested in India that it's internal problems doesn't solve for another 2 decades else India would grow to the world's most powerful country. 
Every bill passed by the government is been protested. Demonetisation or CAA/ NRC, farmers bill, GST, make in India, agniveer everything is been protested in some or the other way, either by stone pelting riots and what not wasting soo much tax payers money being burn down.

'Ra' as in Run
'Tiya' as a combination of a Partial T (approx as in Teal) and yuh as in Yup.

'Na' as in Nun
'Ta' as in Tar.",Neutral
Swc32mFTQug,"I would like to correct you on some points-
'The fanaticism that exists in the hindu nationalist side...' It is true that fanaticism exists in the hindu right but it is also true that it exists in the muslim minority, and to a larger extent considering their population. They are the most backwards and regressive community in india. Some top muslim leaders are known to have given the vilest, most hateful speeches in front of huge audiences and cheered for it. 

RSS is not a hardcore hindu organisation. It is more of a cultural and nationalistic organisation. I can understand that it might be a little confusing on your part since Westerners tend to look at things more from a religious perspective and do not truly understand the difference between culture and religion. RSS even has a muslim wing. Their main prayer goes like 'namaste sada vatsale matrabhoome' which means we offer our eternal honor and respect to the all loving motherland. RSS probably has more of a problem with 'Westernisation' than it has with other minority religions in india.",Positive

1. Indian National Congress from 1984 started to decline bcz of the rise of Coalition govt Era.....Congress formed alliance called UPA....therefore many alliances formed....

2. North India is not called as ""Cow Belt"".....

In India Hindus worship Cow....but there is no such place or region called as Cow Belt.

3. B.J.P (Bharatiya Janta Party) ....is not trying to make India a Hindu dominated State.....but their ideology is 'One Nation One Culture'....I hope u know that India has been ruled by Britishers for more than 300 yrs...and now the present situation can be described as Neo-Colonialism...so their Ideology is to follow Ancient Indian Culture.....

4. There is no such division of religion based .....Our Constitution protects People of all religion....through Right to freedom of religion....

And violence occurs in all countries....name it where it does not ....


5. If there would be any religion based communal violence as a matter of fact....our top bollywood actors are Muslim.....our late  Ex President A.P.J Abdul Kalam was Muslim.....You name it....

So out of 138 Crore Indians if 0.0001% people cannot describe India as Communal based or cow belt...

Swc32mFTQug,"I'd advise you not to use the term ""cow-belt"" as some people in the comments section might get offended.

You see, ""Cow-belt"" is actually a pejorative term used by Far-Left Parties in India for the Hindi-speaking states (where the majority of the population lives) since cow is a holy animal in Hinduism.

Even the Indian National Congress and many other such Centre-left parties have now avoided using this term, as it had resulted in them alienating Hindi-speaking voters, which are the majority in India.

A better term would be Hindi heartland or more simply, Hindi-speaking states.

Swc32mFTQug,"The two major central parties of India are Congress and BJP.
Congress Is a very historic party of India which took a great part in the independence movement while the BJP has its roots to the RSS(Right wing Hindu Body) and other right wing parties.
                A big reason Congress is now unpopular as ever is cause of the corruption scandals of the 2010s and overall the dynastic politics that has plagued the party.
               Which led greatly to the rise of BJP again in the 2014 elections.
                BJP especially Modi however has seen really a worse time for Communal violence,mob lynchings and overall great social unrest.The party in many ways has gone far from the times of Vajpayee(BJP)who is for many the best PM of India.
              The Communist Party never became a really big power in the Centre.However in state politics it was strong but now it only has a stronghold in Kerala.
A big contributor to this demise is the hostility with Communist China and also Naxals (Maoist insurgents) who are also labelled As Domestic terrorists.
                Some examples of famous state level parties are The AAP-Aam Addmi Party(translated to the party of the common man)which has a govt in Delhi,famous for its anti corruption stances.
            Shiv Sena (party which has a strong hold in Maharashtra) which was formally headed by Balasaheb Thackeray.A right wing party itself however the party has now changed with its stance on ""Hindutva"" really different from BJP after the breakup with BJP and now has a large priority to the Marathi identity as it has always done. 
           I only know surface level so I have given a really simplified version of Indian politics.There is a 
Whole different politics In south and north east India.
                Bonus fact
What many people don't know now is that a big reason Modi still has a fairly good reputation after disasters like demonetization is cause of the media and how badly the media is controlled by the govt now.We even have a term called Godi Media for it.",Positive

3)Yes, religious tensions are there in India. Especially in the area of Kashmir, but as far as I know there is a huge movement of Islamic radicalism going on. Various NGOs( foreign funded) and other Islamic groups have caused huge friction, from Kashmir to Kerala.

Then there are news of radicalism and that comes from different parts of India very often. However, there are many Hindu reactionary groups that just add fule to it.

5) Yes, congress is blamed for supporting Muslims as they have passed various laws that not only denied Hindu community from their rights but also gave other communities upper hand.
